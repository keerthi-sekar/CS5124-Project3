1,1,Michael,Eleanor?
1,1,Michael,Come on in.
1,1,Michael,"Hi, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,I'm Michael.
1,1,Michael,How are you today?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm great.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks for asking.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, one question."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where am I?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Who are you, and what's going on?"
1,1,Michael,"Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead."
1,1,Michael,"Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have some questions.
1,1,Michael,Thought you might.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did I die?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't remember.
1,1,Michael,"Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition."
1,1,Michael,Are you sure you want to hear?
1,1,Michael,"All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot."
1,1,Michael,"You dropped a bottle of something called, ""Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One""."
1,1,Michael,"And when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oof.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's how I died?
1,1,Michael,"No, sorry, there's more."
1,1,Michael,"You were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it'd swept you right out into the street where you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called ""Engorge-ulate""."
1,1,Michael,"Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, that's I get it, thank you."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, okay, sorry."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, so who was right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I mean about all of this?
1,1,Michael,"Well, let's see."
1,1,Michael,"Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit."
1,1,Michael,"Jews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's Doug Forcett?
1,1,Michael,"Well, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s."
1,1,Michael,"One night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, ""Hey, what do you think happens after we die?"""
1,1,Michael,And Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct.
1,1,Michael,"I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing."
1,1,Michael,"That's him, actually, right up there."
1,1,Michael,He's pretty famous around here.
1,1,Michael,I'm very lucky to have that.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So maybe my biggest question.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, is this"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or
1,1,Michael,"Well, it's not the heaven-or-hell idea that you were raised on."
1,1,Michael,"But generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place."
1,1,Michael,You're in The Good Place.
1,1,Michael,"You're okay, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,You're in The Good Place.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's good."
1,1,Michael,Sure is.
1,1,Michael,"Okay, let's take a walk, shall we?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, did I have a purse?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm dead, right."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,1,Michael,"So, this is how it works."
1,1,Michael,The Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.
1,1,Michael,Each one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do all the neighborhoods look like this?
1,1,Michael,"No, every neighborhood is unique."
1,1,Michael,"Some have warm weather, some cold."
1,1,Michael,"Some are cities, some farmland."
1,1,Michael,"But in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
1,1,Michael,Yeah.
1,1,Michael,That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.
1,1,Michael,People love frozen yogurt.
1,1,Michael,I don't know what to tell you.
1,1,Michael,"You're gonna have a million more questions, I know."
1,1,Michael,"For right now, better grab a seat."
1,1,Michael,Movie's about to begin.
1,1,Michael,Ah.
1,1,Michael,"Hello, everyone."
1,1,Michael,And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
1,1,Michael,"You were all, simply put, good people."
1,1,Michael,But how do we know that you were good?
1,1,Michael,How are we sure?
1,1,Michael,"During your time on Earth, every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe."
1,1,Michael,"Every sandwich you ate, every time you bought a magazine, every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad."
1,1,Michael,You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?
1,1,Michael,"And they think to themselves, ""Ah, who cares? No one's watching."""
1,1,Michael,We were watching.
1,1,Michael,Surprise!
1,1,Michael,"Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system."
1,1,Michael,"Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to The Good Place."
1,1,Michael,"What happens to everyone else, you ask?"
1,1,Michael,Don't worry about it.
1,1,Michael,"The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived."
1,1,Michael,And you won't be alone.
1,1,Michael,Your true soulmate is here too.
1,1,Michael,That's right.
1,1,Michael,Soulmates are real.
1,1,Michael,"One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soulmate, and you will spend eternity together."
1,1,Michael,So welcome to eternal happiness.
1,1,Michael,Welcome to The Good Place.
1,1,Michael,Sponsored by  otters holding hands while they sleep.
1,1,Michael,You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands?
1,1,Michael,That's how you're gonna feel every day.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So who is in The Bad Place that would shock me?
1,1,Michael,"Uh well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every US president except Lincoln."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds about right.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about Florence Nightingale?
1,1,Michael,"It was close, but, no, she didn't make it."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe."
1,1,Michael,"Again, it's an incredibly selective system."
1,1,Michael,Most people don't make it here.
1,1,Michael,"But you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,"And by the way, welcome to your new home."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, it's perfect, isn't it?"
1,1,Michael,"You see, in The Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one."
1,1,Michael,Exactly.
1,1,Michael,"Oh, I'm so happy you get it."
1,1,Michael,"As you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I do love clowns.
1,1,Michael,"Now, let me show you the, uh, the video system here."
1,1,Michael,You can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
1,1,Michael,There we go.
1,1,Michael,This is your human rights mission to Ukraine.
1,1,Michael,"I mean, you got a ton of points for that one."
1,1,Michael,It really put you over the top.
1,1,Michael,Oh.
1,1,Michael,"Chidi, come on in."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soulmate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bring it in, man."
1,1,Michael,"Now, excuse me."
1,1,Michael,I have other people to attend to.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So where you from, Chidi?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Australia, Hong Kong, Paris."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What about you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Arizona.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your English is amazing.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I'm actually speaking French.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,This place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,So it's incredible.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,And now I want to say this.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-kay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,And now we can actually learn about them together as soulmates.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's overwhelming.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You'll stand by my side no matter what, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Of course I will.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Promise me.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Say, ""I promise I will never betray you for any reason."""
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because those aren't my memories.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wasn't a lawyer.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never went to the Ukraine.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I hate clowns.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's been a big mistake.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not supposed to be here.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, what?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Are you sure this isn't you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death-row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They got my name right, but nothing else."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, somebody royally forked up."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Somebody forked up.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why can't I say ""fork""?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"If you're trying to curse, you can't here."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's bull-shirt.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"So, if you're not this person, then who are you?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What did you do for a living?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was in sales.
1,1,Wallace,"So we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver."
1,1,Wallace,We aim this at seniors.
1,1,Wallace,"Now, you can't legally call it ""medicine"" because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I get it, man."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which one's my desk?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,So your job was to defraud the elderly
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, the sick and elderly?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I was very good at it.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was the top salesperson five years running.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, but that's worse."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you, you do get how that's worse, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, maybe it's a test."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Maybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't risk going to The Bad Place.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Let's just get some information first.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,We'll ask Janet.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, Janet?"
1,1,Janet,Hi there.
1,1,Janet,How can I help you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
1,1,Janet,I'm Janet.
1,1,Janet,I'm the informational assistant here in The Good Place.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,She's like this walking database.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You can ask her about the creation of the universe, or history --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,His name was Kevin Paltonic.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he gay?
1,1,Janet,No.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.
1,1,Janet,That's correct.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway."
1,1,Janet,"Yes, you were."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, Janet, I have a question."
1,1,Janet,Okay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What is The Bad Place like?
1,1,Janet,"Oh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about."
1,1,Janet,I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,1,Woman,The bear has two mouths!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it doesn't sound awesome."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does everyone have a huge house except me?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, we need a plan."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You must've told a few white lies in your life.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, what was your job?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mother-forker!
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I'm getting a stomachache.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm I have a stomachache."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,This is awful.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I, uh I think I have to tell Michael about this."
1,1,Michael,Tell Michael about what?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What have you been up to?
1,1,Michael,"Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu."
1,1,Michael,They are soulmates and your next-door neighbors.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I just say I love your house?
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just so tiny and cute.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,I love it.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just so sweet and teensy.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just like you.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Boop.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,1,Michael,Oh!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You booped me.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's fun.
1,1,Michael,"Tahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I simply adore entertaining."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?"
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see, and he obeys a strict code of silence."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Isn't that right, darling?"
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,So we'll see you tonight?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,My entire house could fit in this room.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, uh help me out here."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Tell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Let's forget about good.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, just tell me something neutral about yourself."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, tell me about the day before you died."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What do you remember?
1,1,Joe,Hi there.
1,1,Joe,Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have a second to eat my farts?
1,1,Joe,You missed.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't remember anything specific.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Oh
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Look.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I might not have been a saint, but it's not like I killed anybody."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wasn't an arsonist.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All I'm saying is these people might be ""good"", but are they really that much better than me?"
1,1,Bambadjan,"Well, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights."
1,1,Gloria,"So we said, ""If the UN won't remove those land mines, we will."""
1,1,Gloria,And we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.
1,1,Sachveer,"Well, then he said, ""You can't give me both your kidneys, you'll die."""
1,1,Sachveer,"And I said, ""But you will live."""
1,1,Sachveer,"And I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, forget it."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Heading to the bar!
1,1,Michael,"Thank you, thank you."
1,1,Michael,You all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.
1,1,Michael,But what you don't know is
1,1,Michael,"Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um"
1,1,Michael,"Oh, what the heck?"
1,1,Michael,This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
1,1,Michael,"I have been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project."
1,1,Michael,Yes!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ah, ah, ah."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hold on there, ace."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me get more of them shrampies.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, easy."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They're for everybody, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, exactly."
1,1,Michael,And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
1,1,Michael,That's it for me.
1,1,Michael,"Back to you, Tahani."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Bravo, Michael, bravo!"
1,1,Michael,Thank you.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Cheers.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, what a condescending bench."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, okay, okay, okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I right?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why does she still have that British accent, right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one else here has an accent.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's choosing to have that accent.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Oh, hello."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe."""
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, okay."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I think it's time to go home.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, wait, wait."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, don't do that."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Don't do no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, creepy house that I hate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, one million clowns."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why aren't there stairs here?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What kind of weirdo house is this?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Did you fill your bra with shrimp?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever, it's freakin' heaven."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At least I can still say ""butthead""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, she is a butthead."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Found some pajamas.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi Chidi, Chidi?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry that you had to deal with this
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's okay.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's not, though."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you think anybody cared that I died?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe someone did.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was an only child.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,My parents were divorced when I was a kid.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They were both crummy people, so they're probably in The Bad Place."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe they're being used to torture each other.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,It would work.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet way more people cared that you died.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause you're a nice person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Aganocomonga.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ags say it again.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, say what you said before."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I did.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's Anagonye.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You just changed it.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I didn't change it, it's my name."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Argrugande.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ariana Grande.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did it.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good night.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Good night.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's terrifying."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That can't be good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,1,Michael,Hmm?
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there?"
1,1,Michael,Ah.
1,1,Michael,"Well, great question, Tahani."
1,1,Michael,No.
1,1,Michael,"No, it's not."
1,1,Michael,I have no idea why any of this is happening or how to control it.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Should we run away then?
1,1,Michael,Yes.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Righto.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, Chidi!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's going on?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are there giant animals everywhere?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,You're not.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,You're the only one who's not.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, this is all happening because of you."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork me."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't know this is because of me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hang on."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not everybody here is perfect, okay?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani is totally condescending.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And there are a couple of, you know, chunksters."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, come on!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No judgment.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So how can we be sure this is my fault?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, then this system sucks."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was a medium person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I should get to spend eternity in a medium place!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like Cincinnati.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, apparently it doesn't work that way."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Unless there is something we can do.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Unless you could teach me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Teach you what?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,How to be good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That was your job, right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,A professor of ethics?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one knew I was a problem when I arrived.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know I'm trying to say ""ash-hole"" and not ""ash-hole"", right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I got that, yes."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, give me a chance."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me earn my place here.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
1,1,Michael,"Hey, guys!"
1,1,Michael,"Uh emergency neighborhood meeting, now!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We'll be right there, Michael!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My soul is in your hands, soulmate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's it gonna be?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, stomachache."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know what to do here.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,This is a mess.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Morally speaking, this is a putrid, disgusting bowl of ethical soup."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, how about we just chill and go to the town meeting and talk it out after?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, how do I make that helper woman show up?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hello?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Front desk lady?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Magical slave robot?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Excuse me, Janet?"
1,2,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still not used to it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, Janet, I need"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Quick question, can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot mailman from your work computer?"
1,2,Janet,It is 100% confidential.
1,2,Janet,"No one can access what you ask me, including Michael."
1,2,Janet,"Now, what kind of pornography would you like to see?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, no, not porn."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I, um I need clothes, like yours and Chidi's with the stripes."
1,2,Janet,There you go.
1,2,Michael,"Everybody, everybody!"
1,2,Michael,"Gather round, please, thank you, thank you."
1,2,Michael,"Obviously, there's something very wrong with this neighborhood."
1,2,Michael,"We don't know what it is, how long it will last, or what caused it."
1,2,Michael,"What do we know, Janet?"
1,2,Janet,We know where it happened.
1,2,Janet,Here.
1,2,Michael,"Yes, thank you, Janet."
1,2,Michael,The chaos happened here.
1,2,Michael,"See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems."
1,2,Michael,One little flaw can lead to
1,2,Michael,"Well, it can lead to Gary over there."
1,2,Gary,"Hey, Gary."
1,2,Michael,"Hang in there, buddy."
1,2,Michael,"Boy, my armpits are leaking."
1,2,Michael,What is that called again?
1,2,Janet,Sweat.
1,2,Michael,"Right, right."
1,2,Michael,Still not used to being in a human body.
1,2,Michael,And what do you do with sweat?
1,2,Michael,"Do you lick it away, is that right?"
1,2,Janet,"No, you dab it with a cloth."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, right."
1,2,Michael,And then you lick the cloth?
1,2,Michael,That seems weirder.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look!
1,2,Michael,Okay.
1,2,Michael,That's a good sign.
1,2,Michael,It could mean that this is almost over.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, such a relief."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That was my first time as a fashion ""don't"", and I did not care for it."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, things are settling down outside."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think it's time to make me good, partner."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do we do it?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where did you get a chalkboard?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"It's The Good Place, you can get anything you want at any time."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you chose a chalkboard?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you reading?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,The Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to duty.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's a book on how to act good.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, great!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you've decided to help me?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,There's a thousand questions.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Is there a moral imperative to help you?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do I have a greater obligation to my community?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"On that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's just wrong about my overall ""quality"" level."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Please, help me, man."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I swear I am worth it.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Tell me one fact that you know about me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, we spent the whole day together."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You must remember something.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What country am I from?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it racist if I say Africa?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, and Africa is not a country."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I am from Senegal.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do I have any siblings?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Where did I go to college?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Trick question.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You didn't.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I was literally a college professor.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do you not remember one single thing about me?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, things have been nuts around here."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet you don't know anything about me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You were born in Phoenix.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You went to school in Tempe.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You're an only child.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Your favorite show is something called The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and your favorite book is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did you know all that?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I think you're wrong."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"What country am I from, again?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sensodyne.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That is a brand of toothpaste.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's your problem.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, names in the hat."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Time to pick a designated driver.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the loser is Betsy.
1,2,Betsy,"Wait, you never get picked, and you're always the one who draws the name."
1,2,Betsy,Let me see that.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no need.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys?"
1,2,Betsy,Give it to me.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For the record I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it."
1,2,Betsy,"If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Again, out of principle."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let it wash over you, Betsy."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is what integrity looks like.
1,2,Michael,"All right, everyone, let's get started."
1,2,Michael,Things have settled down.
1,2,Michael,Phew!
1,2,Michael,"So hopefully, we're off and running."
1,2,Michael,"Welcome to orientation, day two."
1,2,Michael,"Now, today we're gonna start with something that everyone has always wanted to do."
1,2,Michael,Flying.
1,2,Michael,"Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, sorry."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, Michael?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,If if I might?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,We thought perhaps some of us could volunteer to help clean up the debris.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"For those of you who don't know, my soulmate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in The Good Place."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's truly inspiring.
1,2,Michael,"Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, hurrah."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We need about, uh, 12 volunteers."
1,2,Michael,Oh!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Have fun, nerds."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll be soaring through the air like a forkin' bird.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor and I would love to help.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ah.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hurrah, hurrah."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yay.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You want to prove you're not selfish?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Here's the perfect test.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Which do you choose?
1,2,Janet,Have fun.
1,2,Man 1,Hey!
1,2,Man 2,"Oh, hey!"
1,2,Man 3,"Aw, yeah!"
1,2,Man 4,All right!
1,2,Jessica,Whoo!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, up there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably?"
1,2,Jessica,"Well, I wouldn't call it fun."
1,2,Jessica,"I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better."
1,2,Jessica,How's volunteer garbage pickup?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,About the same.
1,2,Jessica,Great!
1,2,Jessica,Whee!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's not really important.
1,2,Michael,Tahani!
1,2,Michael,How goes the cleaning?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, swimmingly, Michael."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
1,2,Michael,"Well, thank you."
1,2,Michael,That's very kind of you to say.
1,2,Michael,But it's also dead wrong.
1,2,Michael,This neighborhood is a disaster.
1,2,Michael,"See, I must have made a mistake somewhere."
1,2,Michael,"And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again."
1,2,Michael,"I'm trying to put a good face on uh, well, this face that I've constructed for myself."
1,2,Michael,"But the truth is, I I'm just miserable."
1,2,Michael,I have to go.
1,2,Michael,Thank you so much for your service.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Powerful people do not handle failure well.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Soulmate, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Should we say it at the same time?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,All right.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"One, two, three."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,We must help Michael.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, you sly devil."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"All right, come on."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's go.
1,2,Antonio,"Oh, boy!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio!"
1,2,Gunnar,"Hey, Eleanor. Isn't this great?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, yeah."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor."
1,2,Antonio,"Us, too!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys are so fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just relentlessly fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I keep thinking, ""When are they gonna stop being fun?"""
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the answer is never.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're never gonna stop.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've made some new friends.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,My area's almost garbage-free.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right?"
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that is a really tough question."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know?"
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,He he compared it to playing the flute.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"The more you practice, the more you improve."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Aristotle!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's my boy, right there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,He was the best.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, most people agree he was the best one."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So it sounds to me like you are onboard the ""Help Eleanor"" train."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities, yes and no."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, no worries."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys."
1,2,Betsy,"Okay, Eleanor, reminder."
1,2,Betsy,"We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Got it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got off work early.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk."
1,2,Betsy,Someone else will do it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good call.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I can't believe they've managed to mix one million flavors together, and yet, somehow, I can taste each individual one."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's remarkable.
1,2,Michael,I got no-flavor.
1,2,Michael,"It's all I deserve, really."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
1,2,Michael,"Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up."
1,2,Michael,"I really do, but you don't understand."
1,2,Michael,This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
1,2,Michael,"It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a fraction of a degree off the whole neighborhood is compromised."
1,2,Michael,Whose dog is that?
1,2,Michael,"Guys, whose dog is that?"
1,2,Michael,Whose dog is that?
1,2,Michael,"See, this is one of those glitches I was talking about."
1,2,Michael,"Nice try, puppy!"
1,2,Michael,Phew!
1,2,Michael,That was a close one.
1,2,Pevita,Teacup!
1,2,Pevita,"Hey, have you seen my dog?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?
1,2,Janet,"Five more minutes, flyers!"
1,2,Janet,Five more minutes!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man, really?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, I'm finished with cleanup, and I'm ready to fly."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do I start?
1,2,Janet,Hop on the launch pad and conjure an image that brings you pure joy.
1,2,Janet,Some people think of their wedding day or favorite vacation spot.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,People puking on roller coasters.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,People puking on roller coasters.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's working!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ow!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm?"
1,2,Michael,"So here's the situation, Pevita."
1,2,Michael,I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
1,2,Michael,But I got her back.
1,2,Michael,Everything everything seems fine.
1,2,Pevita,"Teacup, thank goodness you're okay."
1,2,Michael,"Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog."
1,2,Michael,It feels no pain or joy or love.
1,2,Pevita,Teacup doesn't love me?
1,2,Michael,Oh!
1,2,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love."
1,2,Michael,Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more?
1,2,Michael,Because I can kick her right back into the sun and get you another one just like that.
1,2,Pevita,No!
1,2,Michael,"Oh, boy."
1,2,Michael,I'm making things worse.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, all right, that's all right."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Breathe.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Breathe.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you breathe?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If you do, then just breathe 'cause everything's fine, Michael, it's fine."
1,2,Pevita,It's raining garbage.
1,2,Pevita,Run!
1,2,Michael,"No, no, no, I'm gonna run this way."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Before you say anything
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's it, I just don't want you to say anything."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What did you do?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nothing!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It just started raining trash out of nowhere for no reason at all.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, fine, fine."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But in my defense, there were only five minutes left in flying and I wanted to go flying."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,How is that a defense?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You made a bad choice.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I made a bad choice?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We could have literally been flying, and all you wanted to do was talk about morals."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, you're like the worst part of Superman."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,This is a relief.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I can stop my deliberations.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"You're a selfish person, and it is pointless to help you."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are on your own.
1,2,Antonio,"Oh, man."
1,2,Antonio,"How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar?"
1,2,Gunnar,More cleaning up to do.
1,2,Antonio,It's a it's a dream come true.
1,2,Antonio,We're okay!
1,2,Antonio,You can't die here.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, I mean, even you have to admit, those guys are psycho."
1,2,Michael,I don't know what's happening to me.
1,2,Michael,"I mean, it's my duty to be calm and in control and I'm falling apart."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, Michael, you are a paragon of fortitude."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're a mountain of strength.
1,2,Michael,I'm not a mountain of strength.
1,2,Michael,I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Surely now you will say something.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Please, I'm begging you."
1,2,Michael,Oh.
1,2,Michael,"Yes, yes, I understand."
1,2,Michael,The strength is inside me.
1,2,Michael,It's been there all along.
1,2,Michael,"No, of course, I can overcome any obstacle."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you."
1,2,Michael,I'm back.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,You did it.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, you have so much to teach me."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Maybe I should try to be silent, too."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No really, look."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Here I go.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was wonderful!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,So cleansing.
1,2,Kirk,"Just water tonight, huh?"
1,2,Kirk,Designated driver?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, it sucks."
1,2,Kirk,I think it's awesome.
1,2,Kirk,"I mean, someone's got to do it, right?"
1,2,Kirk,I think it's a cool thing to do for people.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I meant I meant it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I actually prefer it to drinking.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Staying sober and knowing my friends will get home safe, that's my buzz."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys, good news and bad news."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,See that hot bartender over there?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The bad news is, it means I can't drive you guys home."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I did call a cab for you guys.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But they recognized my number, and they didn't want to come."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,So are we good here?
1,2,Betsy,"Eleanor, you have a very important choice to make."
1,2,Betsy,"If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I'm good with that."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll see you guys at work.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Peace!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You, let's go."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did you know I was here?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I saw you from my window.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"That's where I live, by the way."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Not that you ever asked.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What are you doing?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I went to all the places where I dumped trash earlier and cleaned it up so it couldn't be traced back to me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You're doing this because you feel bad.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore, because I told you that's not gonna happen."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio and the whole neighborhood."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I felt bad about what I did.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was a weird feeling.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not used to it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Didn't love it.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I think you're capable of change."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,And I will help you try.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down."
1,2,Janet,Hi there.
1,2,Janet,I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.
1,2,Janet,Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did not tell you to do that.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You are loco, girlfriend."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I won't let you down starting now."
1,2,Michael,"Ah, Eleanor."
1,2,Michael,Good morning.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, do you know what the best part about this place is?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
1,2,Michael,"Oh, I'm so glad you noticed."
1,2,Michael,I was very proud of that.
1,2,Michael,One of the hardest problems I had to solve.
1,2,Michael,"Eleanor, I know what you did."
1,2,Michael,Cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself.
1,2,Michael,"I knew you were special, but this is proof."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I was just doing my part."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, and, um since I'm special, your words, I didn't get to fly."
1,2,Michael,I'm sorry.
1,2,Michael,"No, I've had to ban flying for 1,000 years."
1,2,Michael,Too many injuries.
1,2,Michael,"One resident hit a rotting turkey carcass at a 1,000 miles an hour."
1,2,Michael,It just exploded into this fireball of turkey flesh and bones and sinew.
1,2,Michael,"Anyway, enjoy your coffee."
1,2,Michael,And the cup.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,So I have moved out of my apartment officially and into your guest room.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Figured it would cause less suspicion and make things easier for our ""good person"" lessons."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, just FYI, I'm a very loud snorer."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I like to drip dry in the nude, so eyes to yourself, perv."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Fine.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Now you got a long way to go to pull this off.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,We're gonna have assignments and quizzes and papers.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's gonna be so much fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Remind me what I'm getting out of this again.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You get to avoid eternal damnation.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I got you a present."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Senegal.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's not a present.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's just common decency.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Good talk.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Aw, shirt."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Aristotle was Plato's student."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And Aristotle believes that your character is voluntary, because it's just the result of your actions, which are under your control."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"For example, right now, you have made the insane choice to ignore the person who is literally trying to save you from eternal damnation."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I just are we sure we should be paying attention to these guys?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, who died and left Aristotle in charge of ethics?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Plato.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, coming!"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, we're just kissing."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And groping?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Tahani.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What brings you here?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I was just, uh, in the neighborhood."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Do you get it, Eleanor?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Because, you know, we're all in the same afterlife, so, you know, I'm always in the neighborhood."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you get it?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I do, and it's delightful."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, this is for you."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just a housewarming plant.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's a little reminder that if there's ever anything that you need, I am right next door."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could I possibly forget?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Have a great day, Tahani!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, all right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Welcome to the neighborhood.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Even though we all arrived here at the same time.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Here's some dirt I put in a bowl because I'm amazing.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Chidi."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a total con.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I see through her little act.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Her act of being a nice person who brings you gifts?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bingo.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I'll I'll remind you that you're trying to learn how to be a good person.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe you should return the favor and bring her something.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice and make friends and treat her with mutual respect?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's exactly what she wants me to do, Chidi."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wake up!
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"That, that's what everyone wants everyone to do."
1,3,Michael,"Hello, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,No frozen yogurt for you this morning?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, uh, no, just, uh, doing some reading."
1,3,Janet,"Ugh, been there, brother."
1,3,Janet,"Workin' hard or hardly workin', am I right?"
1,3,Janet,Hump day.
1,3,Michael,"Uh, sorry."
1,3,Michael,"Janet's functioning as my assistant, but she's a little stiff, so I've been trying to get her to be a little more casual and conversational."
1,3,Janet,I'll have what she's having.
1,3,Michael,It's a work in progress.
1,3,Michael,"Listen, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,I've been studying your file.
1,3,Michael,You're a very interesting case.
1,3,Michael,You essentially only did one thing while you were on Earth.
1,3,Michael,You thought and wrote about ethics.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I spent 18 years working on my manuscript called, Who We Are and Who We Are Not"
1,3,Michael,"Right. No, no, no."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Practical Ethics and Their Application in the Modern World; A Treatise on --
1,3,Michael,"Yes, yes, yes, that's the one."
1,3,Michael,That's the one.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Michael,I think you should experience new adventures.
1,3,Michael,"You know, do things that you haven't done on Earth, right?"
1,3,Michael,So why don't we meet tomorrow and try out some new hobbies.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, why not?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I'll see you guys tomorrow.
1,3,Janet,Not if I see you first.
1,3,Janet,Where's the beef?
1,3,Michael,I don't know.
1,3,Janet,Hump day.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, darling, look, it's Eleanor from next door."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he asleep?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yeah, there's really no way to tell."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on in.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"What brings you to our home, my dear?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift with a housewarming gift of my own."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fresh pears.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,So maybe it's a better gift.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's to say?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's so kind.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"However, in, um, Chinese culture, pears are actually a symbol of bad luck."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu, so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw these in the garbage."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But do come and sit down.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,We haven't even had a chance to discuss all of the mayhem in our neighborhood yet.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's so disconcerting.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think is causing it?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm sure I don't know."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we must keep our heads up.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going door-to-door to make sure that every single person in this entire neighborhood is keeping calm and carrying on."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Cause I think that helping others will make me feel like I truly belong here, you know?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Here's a brainstorm, why don't I go with you?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I would love to do my part to help the neighborhood, not to mention, get a little bonding time with you, lady."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hurrah!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What are you talking about?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,This note was slipped under my door yesterday.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It has to be Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She just said to me, ""I want to feel like I truly belong here."""
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, where have I seen the word ""belong"" recently?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah, kaplow!"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I really don't think she's the type of person who would write this.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She is that kind of person and she did write it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And now I'm complimenting her.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And kind of turned on.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, she straight up sucks, bro."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Typical Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brings us a faulty plant so she can brag about being a better gardener.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I think this is another way in which your negative actions affect this world."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"This plant represents your relationship to Tahani, so when you're mean to her, it starts to wilt."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, then this plant is doomed because tomorrow, I'm going with her and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone that she is secretly a two-faced, calculating, phony bench."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, all I want to do is just check in, see how everyone's holding up."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just bring some cheer to these extraordinary people.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, tell me about yourself."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The good, the bad, the really bad, the embarrassing, the humiliating, just let's bond."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, well I was born in Pakistan, raised in London, schooled in Paris, but I think the primary reason that I'm in The Good Place is that I raised quite a lot of money for non-profit groups."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Did you ever, uh, skim a little off the top for yourself?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Gracious, no, no!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Every penny was accounted for.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And as I raised nearly $60,000,000,000, there was quite a lot of pennies."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I also dabbled in some other professions.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was a model, a museum curator, an ""It Girl"", and oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was quite fun.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Modeling?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a crazy life.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Want to tell me about that rock bottom you probably hit?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I didn't really do it for long."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Couture just doesn't fit my body.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm cursed with ample bosom.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And yet you soldier on.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, this is silly"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So ""Tahani"" means ""congratulations"" in Arabic."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And ""Al-Jamil"" means ""beautiful"", so my full name altogether means"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Congratulations, Beautiful."""
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thanks, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,You big flirt.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, babe, got you coffee."
1,3,Samuel,"Oh, great."
1,3,Samuel,"Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh, we shouldn't go there."
1,3,Samuel,Everybody's boycotting.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I know that one guy found a scorpion in his latte."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't really care, though, 'cause it's so close to here."
1,3,Samuel,"No, no, no, it's because he's sexually harassing people."
1,3,Samuel,"Look, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him."
1,3,Samuel,"Here, watch."
1,3,Andy,"Here's the thing, sweetheart."
1,3,Andy,"You're very qualified, but you're also what we call in the coffee shop game a, uh, dog-face."
1,3,Andy,"You're a three, and you have to be a nine to work here."
1,3,Andy,It's just math.
1,3,Woman,"So, I didn't get the job?"
1,3,Andy,"No, dog-face, you didn't get the job."
1,3,Andy,"All right, I'll check your references."
1,3,Andy,Just to be nice --
1,3,Woman,"Hey, my breasts!"
1,3,Andy,I'll check 'em.
1,3,Andy,"Oh, they're good."
1,3,Andy,Honk!
1,3,Samuel,"I mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once."
1,3,Samuel,"No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there."
1,3,Samuel,We can get coffee somewhere else.
1,3,Andy,Did you know your left reference is a little bit bigger than your right reference?
1,3,Andy,"It's not a bad thing, it's just it's a thing."
1,3,Michael,"This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,Cartography.
1,3,Michael,Your neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.
1,3,Michael,"And you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I see how that might be fun.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I have what doctors call, ""directional insanity""."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I once got lost on an escalator.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, not exactly Christopher Columbus."
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, Columbus is in The Bad Place because of all the raping, slave trade and genocide."
1,3,Michael,The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly why you should do it.
1,3,Michael,"You know, get out of your comfort zone."
1,3,Michael,Become a trail-blazer.
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, all deceased members of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team are also in The Bad Place."
1,3,Michael,"Uh, yeah, sorry about this."
1,3,Michael,"I steered her away from colloquialisms and into ""fun facts"" and ""trivia tidbits""."
1,3,Michael,I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, a ""wheelhouse"" is a part of a boat."
1,3,Michael,"Okay, thank you, Janet, thank you."
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, Janet is me."
1,3,Michael,"All right, let's forget about exploring."
1,3,Michael,Plenty more ideas for hobbies.
1,3,Michael,"Let's walk back to town, shall we?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Michael,Wrong way.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Yep.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, Glenn, we just wanted to make sure you were all right."
1,3,Glenn,"Tahani, you're too sweet."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,3,Glenn,Isn't she just the nicest person?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is what a lot of people are saying.
1,3,Glenn,"Oh, everyone I know is saying that."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, it's just a big neighborhood, full of enormous mansions and people who love Tahani!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor and I just want to see if there's anything we can do to help you.
1,3,Cualli,"Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful."
1,3,Cualli,"Despite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please take a maple butter scone.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I made them fresh this morning.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, they look a bit burned."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they're not.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork, that's good."
1,3,Michael,"Extra, extra!"
1,3,Michael,Read all about you.
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, this is the perfect hobby for you."
1,3,Michael,Journalism.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, obviously, I like to write."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,But I don't love deadlines.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I prefer to take my time with things.
1,3,Michael,"Yes, I know."
1,3,Michael,"Uh, you never even named your dog, did you?"
1,3,Michael,"When it ran away, you posted signs saying, ""Responds to long pauses."""
1,3,Michael,"Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to find you a hobby --"
1,3,Michael,The hat --
1,3,Michael,That will bring you a positive experience.
1,3,Michael,What do you say?
1,3,Janet,I'm loving that hat on you.
1,3,Janet,It would look even better on my floor.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What is happening now?
1,3,Michael,"I suggested she be friendlier, she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality."
1,3,Janet,I got something you can slip into.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Oh --
1,3,Michael,"Janet, no!"
1,3,Michael,"No, Janet."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That nod meant no, apparently."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,They all truly belong here.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, they do, cutie-pants. Boop!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I should really be going."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I have to begin my 12 step Korean skincare regiment, but, uh, I'll see -- oh, no, no, no."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please stay and enjoy the evening tea.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll see you soon.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Boop!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil."""
1,3,Michael,Okay.
1,3,Michael,Arc welding.
1,3,Michael,"You could learn sculpture, you can make furniture, you can get your hands a little greasy, you know, and you make things."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,This equipment is very scary!
1,3,Janet,Don't be a baby.
1,3,Janet,It can't hurt you.
1,3,Janet,"Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off."
1,3,Michael,Janet.
1,3,Janet,Whatever.
1,3,Janet,This whole thing is stupid.
1,3,Michael,"Oh, brother."
1,3,Michael,"I told her to be less flirty and now she's cruel and distant, apparently."
1,3,Michael,I just can't get this right.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you for trying to find me a new hobby.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, but I just want to be an academic."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I want to keep working on my manuscript.
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, here's the thing."
1,3,Michael,"See, I read your whole book, all 3,600 pages of it."
1,3,Michael,"It's, um how shall I put this?"
1,3,Janet,"It's a mess, dude."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
1,3,Michael,She's right.
1,3,Michael,"You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety of the world's literature in about an hour."
1,3,Michael,This took me two weeks to get through.
1,3,Michael,"I mean, it's so convoluted, I just keep reading the same paragraph over and over again, trying to figure out what the heck you were saying."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,3,Michael,"I mean, on page 1,000, you start section two with the sentence, ""Of course, the exact opposite might be true."""
1,3,Michael,"You're a brilliant guy, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,But you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.
1,3,Michael,I think you just twisted yourself up into a knot.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I have a very bad stomachache.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Am I a good teacher?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Am I clear?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Do I make sense?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you're a great teacher."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm super ethical now.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What's that?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nah, don't worry about it."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I stole Tahani's diary.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I could see if her handwriting matches the note and also read about all the mean and terrible things she's definitely done, so I can prove she's actually evil."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think that means?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,You stole Tahani's diary.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Why would you even know that?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She wrote that note.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, she didn't!"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,You did!
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I was hoping you would come to this conclusion on your own, but, obviously, no one here would ever threaten you."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,That note is The Good Place manifesting your own guilt.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Like with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wrote myself the note.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And as it turns out, I do belong here."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because I'm just as good as everyone else.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, you don't belong here."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And in this place, everyone is better than you."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,It has been proven by an infallible formula.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Tahani might be a little British and condescending at times, but she devoted her entire life to helping other people."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,She's a good person.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Accept that.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, babe."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great news.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.
1,3,Samuel,Awesome!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, ooh, yikes."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Turns out two of the players have DUIs.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guess we can't cheer for that team.
1,3,Samuel,"Eleanor, I --"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Instead, let's just stay in, watch a Roman Polanski movie, listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-fil-A."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does that sound good?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There's bad stuff everywhere, man."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's impossible to avoid.
1,3,Samuel,"Yeah, but shouldn't we just try?"
1,3,Samuel,Shouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's so much harder to live like that.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it's not like someone's keeping score.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I know you're gonna break up with me, okay?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not an idiot.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I read your emails to your dad.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have fun being so amazing and perfect until you die.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And by the way, I'm talking really fast because I still go to Andy's Coffee, and I got a full punch card, bro."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good people make me insecure.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I'm around someone who I think is better than me, I try and drag them down to my level."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why perfect Tahani is like my kryptonite.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, even admitting that is an important step."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And also, maybe don't listen to me."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I would love not to listen to you.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, what?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Basically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Even Michael couldn't understand it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,So?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does Michael know?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Everything.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"That's my point, he knows everything, and it was too convoluted, even for him."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael does not know everything.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael does not know I'm not supposed to be here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most complicated subjects in the world."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I used to get bored halfway through writing a text message."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be proud.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I want to broaden my horizons and try new things, and I will."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"But even though I might have gotten lost in the weeds, I loved writing this book."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,And I want to try again.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, will you be my advisor?"
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, all I want is for you to be happy."
1,3,Michael,"So if spending eternity getting blunt feedback on your circular, rambling ideas will make you happy, then of course I will be your advisor."
1,3,Michael,Let's throw that monstrosity in the trash and start over.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Aren't there maybe some parts worth salvaging?
1,3,Michael,"Honestly, man, I don't even know."
1,3,Michael,"I mean, that thing is unreadable."
1,3,Michael,I literally learned what headaches were because that thing gave me a headache.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Michael,There you go.
1,3,Michael,New beginnings!
1,3,Michael,Well done.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hi.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, I was just cleaning up."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you want to talk about it?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Desperately.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's Jianyu.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just can't seem to connect with him.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I know that he took a vow of silence, but he won't even talk to me, his soul mate!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I adore talking.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You do.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well I may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you deserve to be happy, because you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not to mention you have a rockin' bod.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, Jianyu may be mute, but he's not blind."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You two belong here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you belong together.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you have all of eternity, so there's plenty of time for things to change."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, thank you."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I really needed to hear that.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, of course your hugs are amazing."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stupid ledge.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,No stairs.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everyone here is really into hugging.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Looks like someone learned something.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it's 'cause someone else is a really good teacher."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, hello."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"How are you, my dear, sweet bestie?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Never better.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's up?
1,3,Michael,"Well, Janet has been acting as my assistant."
1,3,Michael,It's not what she was designed to do.
1,3,Michael,Didn't go great.
1,3,Janet,But now I'm back to normal.
1,3,Janet,It turns out that the best Janet was the Janet that was inside Janet all along.
1,3,Michael,"She was feeling a little lost, so I gave her a self-help book to restore her confidence."
1,3,Janet,Now I'm living my truth and creating my bliss.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, um, look, Michael asked me if I would serve as his assistant, but I'd quite like to focus on my relationship with Jianyu."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,So I recommended you for the job.
1,3,Michael,"Eleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood."
1,3,Michael,Will you help me?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could I say no?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yeah, hurrah!"
1,3,Janet,Hurrah!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What now?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Relax, Eleanor."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sent this to yourself.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is your own guilt manifesting itself.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,I've been waiting for you.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jianyu?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You talk now?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sent me these threatening notes?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the fork, man?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Some Buddhist monk you are.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,You don't belong here.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,Admit it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, you're right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't belong here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael made a mistake.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I'm trying, dude."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm really trying to be a good person.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I think I'm changing for the better, so just please, please don't rat me out."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"Don't worry, I won't."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"Because I'm not supposed to be here, either."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"I don't know how I got here, I have no idea what's going on, and I am freakin' out, homie!"
1,3,Jason Mendoza,You got to help me.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,I'm scared!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hang on, hang on you're not supposed to be here either?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a mistake, just like me?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"There's so much thoughts in my brain, it's like my head is filled with rocks."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,How have you managed to stay undiscovered?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because I have had to dodge and weave and barely escape with my life, and you don't seem like a super genius."
1,4,Michael,"Hello, Jianyu."
1,4,Michael,I'm Michael.
1,4,Michael,"Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence."
1,4,Michael,Would you prefer to remain silent here as well?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You literally haven't said a word since we got here?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"When I say I'm meditating, I'm just trying to figure out what the fork is happening."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I think we might be in an alien zoo or on a prank show.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Jianyu, we're dead."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, that's a dope prank."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Got to give it up.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is your real name Jianyu?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It's Jason Mendoza.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"And by the way, everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm Filipino.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,That's racist.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Heaven is so racist.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,But Tahani said that you helped Michael by putting your hand on his chest and doing some sort of healing magic.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm from Jacksonville, Florida."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It happens a lot.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What did you do for a living?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Electronic dance music.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I was also an amateur hip-hop backup dancer, an amateur body spray inventor um, I did pranks on Vine."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,None of those are jobs.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What did you do to make money?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, here's my biggest question, how did you know that I didn't belong here?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I heard you don't talk.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, here's something for you to not talk about."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't belong here.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,They made a mistake.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Total phony.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,So
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, later, man."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I vaguely remember that.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I believe you, Jason."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not supposed to be here.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
1,4,Michael,"Hello, Tahani."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, Michael."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was just picking out some fresh orchids for my nightly orchid bath.
1,4,Michael,"So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents is opening a new restaurant tonight."
1,4,Michael,This neighborhood could use a real morale boost.
1,4,Michael,"And since you're an expert at event planning, I was hoping that you would help with the grand opening."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Michael, say no more."
1,4,Michael,I wasn't going to.
1,4,Michael,I was done.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, good, because, of course, I will."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
1,4,Janet,"Hey, there."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, darling."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I would like to model tonight's event on my most successful gala.
1,4,Janet,That would be 2006 fundraiser for stem cell research in Barcelona.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Barcelona"", actually."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, it was a perfect evening."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Princess Stephanie was there, as were Posh and Becks."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, International Sophisticate Magazine gave us five Gwyneths."
1,4,Michael,"Tonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders."
1,4,Michael,It's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, good luck."
1,4,Michael,Thank you.
1,4,Michael,"Yes, yes."
1,4,Michael,I'm excited.
1,4,Michael,And a little nervous.
1,4,Michael,I'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.
1,4,Michael,I hope I don't chicken out at the last second.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry we are talking about suspenders, right?"
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like these?
1,4,Michael,You can do that with oh!
1,4,Michael,I cannot wait.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excellent.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Tahani has no idea about me?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"She thinks I'm a monk, and she thinks you're her best friend."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, for us."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a huge bummer for her.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need someplace that we can talk in private.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I agree.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Let me show you my bud-hole.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I should warn you, it's a little messy."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,This is my bud-hole.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"It's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, bud-hole!"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, now I get it."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I wrote down on a piece of paper that I needed a private meditation area.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Tahani will never come in.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Pretty unique decorating style you have here, Jianyu."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, ""12-year-old boy"" meets ""13-year-old boy""."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Thanks.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Janet helped me get all this stuff.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,She rules.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Is she single, or is she married to Michael?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A, she's not human."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And B, you have to keep pretending to be Tahani's soul-mate."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, just sit tight, dude."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have a class to get to.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,What a class?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I didn't know there were classes.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi is trying to teach me to be a good person.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it's really hard.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My whole situation here is getting more and more dicey, so I'm actually really glad to have a place I can come when I just want to be myself."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I miss being myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Myself was the best.
1,4,AcidCat,"What's up, man?"
1,4,AcidCat,You're Jason?
1,4,AcidCat,You got two minutes.
1,4,AcidCat,Fred Durst is throwing an orgy on a partially capsized yacht.
1,4,AcidCat,My dad just texted.
1,4,AcidCat,It already started.
1,4,AcidCat,So I'll get right to the point.
1,4,AcidCat,I listened to your demo.
1,4,AcidCat,You're terrible.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Really?
1,4,AcidCat,Yeah.
1,4,AcidCat,Okay?
1,4,AcidCat,You just don't have any what's the word?
1,4,AcidCat,Talent.
1,4,AcidCat,But don't worry.
1,4,AcidCat,"You got something better than talent, man."
1,4,AcidCat,You got my approximate size and weight.
1,4,AcidCat,"I'm supposed to play this club for the rest of the week, but I just got an offer to DJ Scott Disick's after party for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Whoa, congrats, bro."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,That's the dream.
1,4,AcidCat,"It's your dream, man."
1,4,AcidCat,It's my Tuesday.
1,4,AcidCat,I just need somebody to fill in.
1,4,AcidCat,Put on the helmet.
1,4,AcidCat,Press spacebar on the computer.
1,4,AcidCat,Those idiots won't know the difference.
1,4,AcidCat,"For the next week, Jason, you are Acidcat."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Whoa.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,There's a lot of old gum in here.
1,4,Chef Patricia,"Tahani, how are things going in the front of the house?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,"Because, to be perfectly frank, things in the kitchen are going great, okay?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,I am right on schedule.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked every single detail."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Your restaurant opening is going to be the talk of the entire neighborhood.
1,4,Chef Patricia,Thank you for your thoughtfulness and hard work.
1,4,Chef Patricia,I could not have done this without you.
1,4,Michael,"Ah, hello, Tahani."
1,4,Michael,Sorry.
1,4,Michael,I should've warned you.
1,4,Michael,"Patricia is actually very happy, but she's also very intense."
1,4,Michael,It can be confusing.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no, no, that's not what's bothering me."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited."
1,4,Michael,Right.
1,4,Michael,"Jianyu is a beautiful spirit, but he literally doesn't talk, and since this will be an evening of lively conversation, and you'll be busy working, I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I totally understand.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well reasoned, Michael."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As us Brits are fond of saying, ""Try your best to hide your sadness."""
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"So, the concept of the self is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu wrote, ""Knowing others is wisdom, but knowing the self is enlightenment."""
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ah ""knowing"" yourself."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he talking about what I think he's talking about?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, Eleanor."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"You read this, right?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I tried to."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I tried to want to."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Mm, actually, could we postpone this lesson?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've befriended Jianyu from next door, and I thought I could learn from him."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,That's a great idea.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Hume's ""bundle theory"" of the self is fairly close to Buddhism."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,No durr.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why I'm doing it.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Do you hear music?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's not music.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's EDM.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you doing?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Eleanor, you were right."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No more pretending.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It's time for me to be myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"What's up, homie?"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You broke Jianyu.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, did we miss anything?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Take that jersey off, you goofball."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is not my fault.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I swear.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But here's the thing, Jianyu is actually a guy who is nice."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Tahani."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't mind me.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm just dropping off my afternoon gloves, and picking up my early evening gloves."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"How are you, soul-mate?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm cool.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Am I going mad, or did I just hear you say, ""I'm cool""?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mm.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mm-hmm.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think so.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think that happened.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you're wrong."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I see what's going on here.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,You've got a whisper in your snicker box.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're both helping Jianyu to regain his confidence to be able to speak again as a surprise for me!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, busted."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,My heart is soaring.
1,4,Michael,"So, Jianyu is talking?"
1,4,Michael,"Oh, how wonderful!"
1,4,Michael,I will do everything in my power to encourage him.
1,4,Michael,"Well, not everything."
1,4,Michael,I won't give him a second mouth.
1,4,Michael,Unless that would be helpful.
1,4,Michael,No.
1,4,Michael,Better not risk it.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've actually had a better idea.
1,4,Michael,Oh.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi and Eleanor have been working with him, and they're going to be here."
1,4,Michael,What a great idea.
1,4,Michael,Patricia!
1,4,Michael,"We can fit another chair, right?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,Change the floor plan an hour before opening?
1,4,Chef Patricia,Of course!
1,4,Chef Patricia,The more the merrier!
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hurrah!"
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I knew tonight was going to be perfect, but now it's going to be even perfect-er."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Obviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect"
1,4,Michael,"Well, it isn't, actually."
1,4,Michael,Any place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.
1,4,Michael,That's how you got Beyonce.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Oh bud-hole.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay now, tell me everything."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Jianyu is a fraud, just like me."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,His real name is Jason.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's gonna be fine.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We just need a plan.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I got a plan."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"We hack into Michael's phone, download all his nudes, and then blackmail him."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you no.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, you should listen to me."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I came up with hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me killed."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, be quiet."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are not Jason.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are a monk named Jianyu.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Got it?
1,4,Pillboi,"Oh, another great set, Jason."
1,4,Pillboi,"They love you, dude."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"They don't love me, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,They love Acidcat.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,These cheers are fake.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,They hit my ears like boxing gloves of sadness.
1,4,Pillboi,"Oh, that's some poetic thoughts, B."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I got to be myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Attention, Jacksonville."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm not Acidcat.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm Mr. Music, the DJ."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"And this is a Mr. Music, the DJ original."
1,4,Michael,Welcome to the opening of The Good Plates.
1,4,Michael,I just got that.
1,4,Michael,That's hilarious!
1,4,Michael,"Anyway, at some point or another, every resident in this neighborhood will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose."
1,4,Michael,Chef Patricia has done that tonight by opening this restaurant.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Now if you'd all like to take a look at tonight's menus
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's right.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"With Michael's help, Chef Patricia has recreated each person's favorite meal on Earth."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fun!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,It's my Grandmother's maafe.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Fresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Almost makes me forget how miserable I am right now.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You want to try a bite?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fish and peanut butter?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Tofu?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Imma order some jalapeno poppers.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be quiet and eat your white sponge.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
1,4,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't get a meal.
1,4,Janet,"According to our files, your favorite meal was the hunger strike you went on to protest Bolivian sex trafficking."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, right."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course I did that.
1,4,Michael,"Tahani, great party."
1,4,Michael,Check it out.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,4,Michael,Suspenders!
1,4,Michael,So dumb.
1,4,Michael,So much dumber than belts.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, congratulations, Michael."
1,4,Michael,How's Jianyu doing?
1,4,Michael,Is he opening up?
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Mm, not yet."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I can tell he wants to.
1,4,Michael,Don't worry.
1,4,Michael,I've got a plan.
1,4,Michael,"May I have your attention, please?"
1,4,Michael,"Later this evening, we will be enjoying Chef Patricia's delicious dessert, a stunning three-tiered cake that took her a full week to complete."
1,4,Michael,"But first, I'd like to try something fun."
1,4,Michael,Each one of you has a very special memory attached to the meal you're eating.
1,4,Michael,Why don't we go around the room and share our stories?
1,4,Glenn,"I'll start, Michael."
1,4,Glenn,"One day, I wasn't feeling so great, so I made myself a bowl of this chicken soup"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When it gets to you, say something short and boring about tofu."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which is?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Wings were free for ladies if they took their top off.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, a word?"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,4,Glenn,"Anyway, that's how this simple soup saved over 10,000 lives."
1,4,Michael,Ah!
1,4,Michael,Fabulous!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Jianyu starts talking about topless Buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed."
1,4,Michael,"Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence at the age of eight and hasn't spoken since, is ready to share with us."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need a distraction.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right the fork now!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no, no, no."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Chef Patricia poured her heart and soul into this.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Destroying it would be a truly cruel act.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no durr."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no!"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
1,4,Michael,Sinkhole!
1,4,Michael,Everyone out!
1,4,Michael,There's a sinkhole!
1,4,Michael,Glenn!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You broke the world.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,It's not a compliment!
1,4,Michael,"Glenn, stay calm."
1,4,Michael,We're gonna get you out of there.
1,4,Michael,And we'll put your soup in the fridge so it won't go to waste.
1,4,Michael,"I know that may not be your number one concern right now, but"
1,4,Glenn,It was up there.
1,4,Glenn,It's real good soup.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You okay?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I was just to tell an awesome story about a wing-eating contest that I lost, and a barfing contest that I won, but then a hole opened up in the ground."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I made the hole to save you from yourself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You cannot let people know who you really are.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It would be very, very bad."
1,4,Pillboi,"Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville."
1,4,Pillboi,"What's wrong, dog?"
1,4,Pillboi,You look like you're freaking out.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Things are bad, Pillboi."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Acidcat is suing me for ""bleach of contract""."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I should have never pretended to be someone else.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It could cost me all my dreams in life.
1,4,Pillboi,You got dreams in life?
1,4,Pillboi,That's lit.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Of course I have dreams, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I don't want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa, even."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I want it all.
1,4,Pillboi,"That's big goals, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I know, but I believe in myself."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Someday, the world will see what I already know, that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Hand me the thing that blows it up.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, I hereby tender my resignation."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can no longer in good conscience coordinate any further events in The Good Place.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, I am turning in my evening gloves."
1,4,Michael,Tahani --
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't try to make me feel better.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,The launch was a disaster.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Poor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,My hair is barely cascading down my shoulders.
1,4,Michael,"Tahani, please."
1,4,Michael,"I know your journey with Jianyu has been frustrating, but your situation is actually very typical."
1,4,Michael,Soul mates sometimes take months to really click.
1,4,Michael,You have to be patient.
1,4,Michael,"And if anyone should take blame for the restaurant disaster, it's me."
1,4,Michael,I thought this neighborhood's troubles were behind us.
1,4,Michael,Now I fear the worst.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,We must keep the neighborhood together.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,What can I do?
1,4,Michael,"Oh, well, the sinkhole should be repairing itself in about three days."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, as soon as it does, we shall re-launch the restaurant."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll hang posters to get the word out, and in the meantime, I'll host a brunch party every morning to lift people's spirits."
1,4,Michael,Ah!
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"While you repair the universe, I shall prepare the eggs."
1,4,Michael,"Oh, fanciful wordplay."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Indeed.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is the Tahani that you know and love.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,So what do we do here?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's nothing to do.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's hopeless.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"I can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"I will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"And if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"No, I'm good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, Chidi is giving you a lifeline right now, and you need to take it because you suck."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,You suck!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I'm trying to tell you.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We both suck.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know who doesn't suck?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I didn't get into heaven to go to school.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You didn't get into heaven at all, shirt-for-brains."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I just want to be myself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's a very, very bad idea."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do not be yourself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You need to be a better version of yourself, okay?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I do too.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And our only hope right now is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Think about that.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Do you have to call me a nerd so much?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I said a lot of other nice things, okay?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Toughen up, nerd."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let's get crackin', Teach."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, that's really impressive."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, where's Jianyu?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, I don't even know if he's coming."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I am here to learn about ethnics.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Wow!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"That's great, man!"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, I mean it's ethics but that's great."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Pretty sure it's ""ethnics""."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy, I'm proud of you."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is your first step towards not sucking.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I just have two questions.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,When are football tryouts?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,And does this school have a prom?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For the first time ever, I'm the smartest kid in class."
1,5,Janet,"Good afternoon, Eleanor."
1,5,Janet,What can I get you today?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lot of new flavors.
1,5,Janet,"Michael felt bad about the sinkhole, so he wanted to give you all a little treat."
1,5,Janet,"I recommend ""Full Cell Phone Battery""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I'm so relaxed."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they all look good.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,This might take me a while.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, Gunnar, why don't you go ahead?"
1,5,Gunnar,"Thanks so much, Eleanor."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Janet,"What can I get you, Gunnar?"
1,5,Gunnar,"Hi, Janet."
1,5,Gunnar,Can I have some Folded Laundry?
1,5,Janet,Coming up.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'll never believe it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, ""Why don't you go ahead?"""
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just like that!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Why don't you go ahead?"""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Okay
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you don't understand!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But now, thanks to your ""good person"" lessons, I didn't hold up the line."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't even try a dozen samples I didn't want just to spite some jerk who told me I was holding up the line.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You do that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Chidi, I used to do that."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now I do selfless things without even thinking about it.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,That's great.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I'm I'm proud of you.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,So where's our yogurt?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I forgot it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh can you go?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't want to go all the way back.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I ran all the way here and it was so hot.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good person.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"So, to sum up, Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I like this one.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's simple.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh screw all the other complicated theories, why didn't you start with this one?"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, but here's the problem."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"If all that matters is the sum total of ""goodness"", then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive war"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dude, I get it."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"It's like, I knew this girl Sheila she was a black market alligator dealer with a pierced jawbone."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Um okay, what?"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"Sheila was gonna get married to my boy, Donkey Doug and make him move to Sarasota."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,It would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,I framed one innocent gator dealer to save a 60-person dance crew.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Shockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Well done.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Thanks!
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Um
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yes, Jianyu?"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Can I be excused?
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to get there before all the mini-waffles run out.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Go ahead, man."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you want to roll right into another lesson?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I am revved up to learn, man."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,My brain is horny!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Um can we take a little break?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah, I get it."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of dharma."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with ""Interestingly"""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, I'll do that and, uh we can start another lesson."
1,5,Michael,Ah!
1,5,Michael,Tahani.
1,5,Michael,I've been working on my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.
1,5,Michael,Tell me what you think.
1,5,Michael,That New Yorker article was crazy.
1,5,Michael,You haven't seen Hamilton?
1,5,Michael,"Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Very well done, Michael."
1,5,Janet,"Hi, there!"
1,5,Janet,We have a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis.
1,5,Michael,A Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
1,5,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, what is a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?"
1,5,Michael,"It's nothing, it's a tiny little inconvenience."
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear?"
1,5,Janet,It appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.
1,5,Michael,"This is very bad, Janet."
1,5,Michael,We have to go into the sinkhole and fix it by hand.
1,5,Michael,Get the tools.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, can I be of any service?"
1,5,Michael,Ah!
1,5,Michael,Tahani.
1,5,Michael,Didn't see you there.
1,5,Michael,"Uh, no, no."
1,5,Michael,We're just having a slight problem with the enormous sinkhole.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, I meant to tell you I walked past it last night and I I actually saw it get a little bit bigger."
1,5,Michael,It got bigger?
1,5,Michael,"Ah, well, that's so normal."
1,5,Michael,Uh this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.
1,5,Michael,"I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Finally!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's get back to it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whip out that chalkboard, big boy, show me what you're working with."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, I was going to head into town and pick up some blankets."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Great, I'll grab my sweater."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can practice letting people cut in front of me.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, uh, I just realized that I have blankets, so I'm going to take a nap using the several blankets that I already have."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Good night.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Out with it.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Fine, I'm just tired, need a break."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,No big deal.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,The way you're talking to me right now?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Everything's cool, no big deal"", I know that move."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I told a boyfriend something was ""no big deal"", it meant anything from ""I just bought weed from your nephew"", to ""I secretly befriended your ex-girlfriend last year, things got out of hand, and now I'm her bridesmaid""."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, well, in this case, it really is no big deal."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you're hiding something!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is wrong?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, 2nd."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well done, my love."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,So where am I?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, 6th?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm second to last.
1,5,Young Tahani,"Mummy, I made you this."
1,5,Young Tahani,It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Thank you, Tahani."
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,It's very competent.
1,5,Young Kamilah,"I made a bird, as well."
1,5,Young Kamilah,"I worked in a reflective alloy, holding up a mirror to mankind and its mistreatment of these defenseless animals."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Excellent, Kamilah."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,I sense the influence of Brancusi and Kapoor.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,"It seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction."
1,5,Young Kamilah,"Good eye, Mother."
1,5,Young Kamilah,I grew tired of objective representation.
1,5,Young Kamilah,I trust my audience.
1,5,Young Tahani,My birdie has a hat.
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Yes, well done, Tahani."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Would you stop doing that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, fine!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You want to know what's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You are a full-time job.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I wake up, there's Eleanor."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I spend all day teaching Eleanor.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And then it's, ""Good night, Eleanor."""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, this is a nice dream, my grandma's here."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, she's got Eleanor's face!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,And tentacles for some reason.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought you liked teaching me.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So now I'm just some huge burden for you?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Yes!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Of course you are!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I am in paradise!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I should be doing paradise things, like rowing out on a lake with a good bottle of wine, reading French poetry."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's your idea of paradise?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, and I can't stop helping you, because then I am shirking my ethical duty."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,It's an impossible position!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, if you're so stressed from writing on a chalkboard, why don't you just leave?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We could pretend to be soul mates in public, but other than that, we don't have to see each other!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Fine with me!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I'll move out right now.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine!
1,5,Michael,Good afternoon.
1,5,Michael,"As you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center."
1,5,Michael,"The situation, sadly, has worsened."
1,5,Michael,"Starting right now, no one may go outside under any circumstances."
1,5,Michael,"Leaving your homes could result in catastrophic damage, to you and to the very fabric of the universe."
1,5,Michael,"Okay, bye."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or we could both just stay here.
1,5,Michael,We hope you enjoy your eternal stay in The Good Place.
1,5,Michael,"Take advantage of our day spa, or Janet a magical assistant who can get you whatever you want."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You mind turning that off?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,It's been playing on a loop for two days.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,The whole Neighborhood is offline.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We only get the welcome channel.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What have you done to me, you monster?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Look at all these dishes piling up.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I did that.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I cleaned the dishes.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then what's up with these bad boys?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You are unbelievable.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you still upset?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not over it yet?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,How can I be over it?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice ""vacation"" from your ""full-time job""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Get your story straight, bro!"
1,5,Michael,"Hey, guys, it's Michael."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise."
1,5,Michael,"Oh, I'd love to make small talk."
1,5,Michael,"I've been practicing, too."
1,5,Michael,"I'm amazing at it, but I'm in a bit of a rush here."
1,5,Michael,This is Bart and Nina.
1,5,Michael,"They live right next door to the, uh, sinkhole, so they obviously need a place to stay."
1,5,Michael,"I was wondering, as my assistant, maybe you could put them up for a while?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, of course."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't think twice.
1,5,Michael,"Okay, shouldn't take long."
1,5,Michael,"Between an hour and, um, 11 months."
1,5,Michael,Somewhere in there.
1,5,Michael,"Okay, bye."
1,5,Michael,Don't go outside.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to day three of our brunch siege."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I stayed up all night to plan a full day of fun activities.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just check the schedule I made.
1,5,Henriette,"Tahani, you are truly the best."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, you would think so, wouldn't you, Henriette?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Still second to last.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,Tahani!
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,This auction threatens to be an embarrassing failure.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,5.2 million isn't bad.
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"It's very ""middle-thermometer""."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,Your public failure is our public failure.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,You know what has to be done.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm very pleased to announce that there has been an addition to today's docket.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamilah.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person ever to graduate from Oxford University."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"She's a world-class painter, social activist, iconoclast, Olympic gold medalist for archery, a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary on her Grammy Award-winning album, and the person voted ""Most Likely to be Banksy""."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So without further ado, take it away from me!"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah."
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"The bidding shall commence at �3,000,000."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,Five million!
1,5,Nina,Thank you guys so much.
1,5,Nina,Sorry for the imposition.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh bah!
1,5,Bart,"Oh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you."
1,5,Bart,We are obsessed with your relationship.
1,5,Bart,"Always whispering, locking yourself in the house all day."
1,5,Nina,I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job.
1,5,Nina,But I have a lot to learn from you guys.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your job?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What was your job?
1,5,Nina,I was a marriage counselor.
1,5,Nina,You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.
1,5,Nina,And I did!
1,5,Nina,"It's called, How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From a 100 Miles Away."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, cool."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, cool."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really cool.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Really, really cool."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Cool, cool."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And what about you, Bart?"
1,5,Bart,"Oh, well, my job wasn't nearly as interesting."
1,5,Bart,I started a company that investigated identity theft.
1,5,Bart,"Analyzing body language, tracking and catching people pretending to be someone they're not."
1,5,Bart,"It's snooze, am I right?"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,They're gonna catch us!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,This is an extremely precarious situation!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I am vexed, Eleanor!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they have no reason to suspect us!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we do it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It'll get 'em to stop asking questions.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I I am not going to have sex with someone to get them to stop talking to me!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and I are very different.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I noticed!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, man?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I have spent every second in this place worried I was gonna get caught, but if we go down right now, that's on you, okay?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you spend all your time teaching a charming, awesome lady?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,How sad for you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Face it, dude."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because guess what, Chidi?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya basic!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like, ""Whoa! This is hot,"" and we start making out."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dream on!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"No, Eleanor, look."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So how much of that did you hear?
1,5,Bart,"We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear you are in conflict."
1,5,Nina,We're not judging you.
1,5,Nina,This has been a tough couple of weeks.
1,5,Nina,I'm sure the stress of the sinkhole has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, that's what it is."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,A squabble.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're squabbling.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Squabble, squabble!"
1,5,Nina,I can help.
1,5,Nina,I'm gonna take your relationship and put it under a microscope and dig and poke and prod until you are back to soul mate harmony.
1,5,Nina,"Eleanor, why don't you --"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,She never does the dishes.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I have to do them all the time.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We just have different interests.
1,5,Nina,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I like relaxing, he likes getting on my case about the dishes."
1,5,Bart,I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.
1,5,Bart,"I suspected this when I arrived, but now I'm sure."
1,5,Bart,You are hiding something.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What on Earth would I be --
1,5,Bart,"No, no, no, not you."
1,5,Bart,Him.
1,5,Michael,Please go back inside.
1,5,Michael,It isn't safe to be out of your home.
1,5,Michael,Please go back inside.
1,5,Michael,"Janet, could you see what's wrong?"
1,5,Janet,Everything.
1,5,Michael,Oh
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,My goodness!
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's even worse than I thought.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, what're you doing here?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, everyone else might be okay staying inside, but I wanted to help."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,So I've brought some cheer and sustenance to raise your spirits.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I made donut holes."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you get it?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Donut holes""?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sinkhole.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Funny, no?"
1,5,Janet,"No, too soon."
1,5,Janet,By exactly nine days.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous."
1,5,Michael,"If a human gets too close to it, there could be disastrous side effects."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's what's happening to me?
1,5,Michael,"Oh, that's one of the side effects."
1,5,Michael,"Janet, knock her out while we still have time."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Knock me out?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,What does that --
1,5,Janet,Boop!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Guys, really, it's no big deal."
1,5,Nina,"""It's not a big deal"" is nearly always code for ""something is wrong""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Boom!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I said.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I should've been a marriage counselor.
1,5,Bart,"Okay, Chidi, out with it."
1,5,Bart,What is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Be honest, Chidi."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Be, like, the exact right amount of honest so that we can both be happy."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I never had a soul mate on Earth.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I never even really had a girlfriend that I loved.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,And it isn't exactly what I thought.
1,5,Nina,You've never had an intense relationship before.
1,5,Nina,This is all uncharted territory.
1,5,Bart,No wonder you're so tense.
1,5,Bart,"You know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage."
1,5,Bart,"Uh, not erotic massage."
1,5,Nina,Mmm.
1,5,Bart,"Although, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, you know what?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys have given us so much to think about.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think we should go to bed.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just the two of us, alone."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just us.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know it's not the right time, but I told you."
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, wake up, dear."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did it work?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did I fix the sinkhole?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Am I a heroine?
1,5,Michael,"No, you did something catastrophically stupid and we had to knock you unconscious."
1,5,Michael,Why in the world did you go outside?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Because I saw the rankings in the manual.
1,5,Michael,That manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.
1,5,Michael,It's got some very sensitive material.
1,5,Michael,"Plus some song lyrics I've been working on, and I'd rather not let people see those until they're finished."
1,5,Michael,"But, anyway, why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?"
1,5,Eunice,I was so sorry to hear of your parents' passing.
1,5,Eunice,Please bear with me as I share their last will and testament.
1,5,Eunice,"""To Kamilah, we have left �68,000,000, the home in Kensington, the yacht, and other assorted weekend boats."""
1,5,Eunice,"Well, what did they leave their second favorite child?"
1,5,Eunice,"There's still quite a lot of, uh, money and property that goes to you."
1,5,Eunice,"There is one issue, however."
1,5,Eunice,"They have, um, spelled your name incorrectly in the will."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,You've got to be kidding me.
1,5,Eunice,"It says, ""We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini."""
1,5,Eunice,Like the sauce.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,You know what?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't want the money.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,My sister can have it all.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My whole life, I have lived in your shadow, but now I'm going to step out of it."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am going to reach heights of success and sophistication that you can only dream of.
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Your cardigan's on inside out.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I know!
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a new trend that I am starting.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just one example of how I'm going to step out of your shadow.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I just don't understand how I'm so low.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My entire life, I have tried to be extraordinary, but it just never seemed to be enough."
1,5,Michael,Ah and you thought you could increase your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, the point evaluations stop the moment you die."
1,5,Michael,"But also, out of literally billions, you were one of the most remarkable people on Earth."
1,5,Michael,"You have nothing left to prove, to anyone."
1,5,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,5,Janet,The sinkhole has begun to repair itself.
1,5,Michael,It has?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Could it be did I?
1,5,Michael,But how
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Tahani saves the --"""
1,5,Michael,"No, no, no."
1,5,Michael,Still not you.
1,5,Michael,You have nothing to do with it.
1,5,Michael,We've got to leave immediately.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Morning, teach!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Mornin'.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,What's this about?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, here's what I realized."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Every ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I've never actually done this before.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,This is a theoretical fantasy.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,How do you row a boat?
1,5,Michael,"I'll tell ya, it's good as new."
1,5,Michael,"Go ahead, if you want, just here."
1,5,Michael,See?
1,5,Michael,You can jump up and down on it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, boss."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you fixed the sinkhole.
1,5,Michael,"Yup, good as new."
1,5,Michael,Crisis averted.
1,5,Michael,"Everybody have a wonderful day, because I fixed the sinkhole."
1,5,Michael,I didn't fix the sinkhole.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry?
1,5,Michael,"I tried and I tried, but nothing worked."
1,5,Michael,"And then all of a sudden this morning, out of the blue, it just it just closed over."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh how 'bout that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news."
1,5,Michael,"No, this is terrible news!"
1,5,Michael,"I have no idea what caused it, Eleanor."
1,5,Michael,And no idea what fixed it.
1,5,Michael,I want you to come to my office first thing in the morning.
1,5,Michael,You and I are gonna find this problem.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,What are you doing?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, I'm freaked out about my meeting with Michael, and if I spend one more second staring at Creepo the Clown, I'm gonna lose it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You named the clowns?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Psycho, Creepo, Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo, Freaky Feet and Nightmare George Washington."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,One of them has to go.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, sexy mailman."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Much better.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I did promise I would help."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I do here?
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, the answer is"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right here, in this easily understandable comic strip."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Nope, in this book about the theory of contractualism."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What We Owe to Each Other.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I saw this movie.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Laura Linney cries in a lake house because Jude Law left her for his ex-wife's ghost.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Quick summary of contractualism.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, ""If your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free""?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"So, if you said, ""We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions"", someone would veto that rule."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's called ""tyranny""."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,And it's generally frowned upon.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"If you make a promise to someone, you should do it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Just like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Despite your constant mockery."""
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever, you love it."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need to figure out a way to both help him and not help him at the same time.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,That's literally not possible.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, really?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I once posed as a hot prom date for my cousin, both helping him and later, according to his therapist, not helping him."
1,6,Michael,"Oh, hey, Eleanor."
1,6,Michael,Thanks for coming in.
1,6,Michael,Sorry about the mess.
1,6,Michael,"Oh, I forgot, you don't see in nine dimensions."
1,6,Michael,There's just a lot of there's a lot of tension in the air right now.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are you okay, buddy?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You seem kind of stressed.
1,6,Michael,"No, no, no, I'm fine."
1,6,Michael,"Top of my game, actually."
1,6,Michael,"Um, here, let me just have a seat."
1,6,Michael,There you go.
1,6,Michael,"So, to prepare to meet all of you, I studied the human concept of friends."
1,6,Michael,I even watched all ten seasons of the show Friends.
1,6,Michael,"Boy, those Friends really were friends, weren't they?"
1,6,Michael,"Although, and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being how did they afford that apartment?"
1,6,Michael,A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we were all confused about that too."
1,6,Michael,"Anyway, it's been a tough couple of days."
1,6,Michael,"Right now, I could really use a friend by my side."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you know me, the person who has audibly promised to help you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you need me to house-sit the whole week?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vacay.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"As I told you before, my mom is very sick."
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,I'm gonna help her move into assisted living.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm here for you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in."
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"Walk and feed him twice a day, give him his kidney medicine."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yup, got it."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Feed his kidneys.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,Eleanor
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah?
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,I need to know that I can count on you.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I won't let you down.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promise.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, my love."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,How are you?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,I am decidedly so.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's very profound.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Um, soulmate."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,An idea.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Our neighborhood now features a spa, and it offers couples packages."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I thought maybe we could get facials, and do yoga, and talk in long, discursive sentences."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,What do you say?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Signs point to yes.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Marvelous!
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,We'll go today.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, you got to come with us to the spa."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No way.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"No, that's really weird."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"No, I can't."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,She freaks me out.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"She's so pretty, like Nala from The Lion King."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"And she talks so smart, like Nala from The Lion King."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,You gotta help me.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Although, maybe it's better not to know."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You ready, Jianyu?"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I cannot wait to just relax, and talk, and chat and just, you know get to know each other."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe I'll come too.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, Chidi it's just that this is, um this is really more of a couples thing."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Right?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Made in Taiwan.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, you were."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You were made in Taiwan.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,So couples date!
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Let's go!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never really looked around your office the first day.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is all this junk?
1,6,Michael,"Well, technically, architects aren't allowed to own any human objects, but oh, I just love them so much."
1,6,Michael,"And over here, look at this."
1,6,Michael,Aren't paper clips the most amazing things in the world?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
1,6,Michael,"Anyway, my current theory is that some object in the neighborhood is a design flaw which is causing everything to go haywire."
1,6,Michael,So we need to find that object.
1,6,Michael,We're gonna start with the rocks.
1,6,Michael,"Now, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood."
1,6,Michael,These 78 are the most suspicious.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, maybe to an architect they might look suspicious, but to me, they just look like rocks, so I'm not sure how I can help."
1,6,Michael,Do any of them look defective?
1,6,Michael,Sinister?
1,6,Michael,"You know, like they're taunting you?"
1,6,Michael,Always one step ahead?
1,6,Michael,"You devious little monsters, you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, let's take a deep breath here, buddy."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need to chill a little.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cause you have a very psycho, ""burnout guy muttering to himself at a library computer"" type vibe."
1,6,Michael,It's my responsibility to solve the problem.
1,6,Michael,What else can I do except keep working?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You could stop working.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break."
1,6,Michael,And not working will help me work?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Recharge the old batteries.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promise this is gonna help both of us.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,6,Michael,Okay.
1,6,Michael,Let's keep our eyes peeled for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, crazy, come on."
1,6,Michael,Yeah.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Janet."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu and I are here for the couples package, please."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"And, also, I will be joining them."
1,6,Janet,"Great, and who is the other half of your couple?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no, no, it's just me."
1,6,Janet,Couples are pairs of people.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,And then also I am here.
1,6,Janet,"Great, and who will be joining you?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No one.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, it's really quite simple, Janet."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"They are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,It's a three-person couple.
1,6,Janet,Does not compute.
1,6,Janet,Does not compute.
1,6,Janet,I'm just kidding.
1,6,Janet,"I mean, it doesn't compute, but I'm not gonna explode or anything."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Right.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I'll see you inside, darling."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, you have to step up."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Find a way to connect with her without, you know, being you."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,What does that even mean?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Do I talk or not talk?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw all her jewelry in the toilet?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,That's the opposite of being nice?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,So no toilet?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is it with you and frozen yogurt?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have you not heard of ice cream?
1,6,Michael,"Oh, sure, but I've come to really like frozen yogurt."
1,6,Michael,There's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ha!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is very human.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why do you need a human to be your assistant?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, aren't there more of whatever you are?"
1,6,Michael,"Well, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Weird combo to pick, but okay."
1,6,Michael,I'm gonna tell you a secret.
1,6,Michael,"Usually, architects don't live in their neighborhoods."
1,6,Michael,"Usually, the people show up, we play the movie, Janet is there to answer questions, and you're on your own."
1,6,Michael,But I had this theory.
1,6,Michael,"I thought transition would be easier if the architect were on-site for at least the first 1,000 years or so."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's why you've been so freaked out, 'cause your butt is on the line."
1,6,Michael,My boss thought I was nuts.
1,6,Michael,"And if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble."
1,6,Michael,"But more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy."
1,6,Michael,And you just don't break a promise.
1,6,Michael,"Unlike Ross, when he promised Emily not to talk to Rachel."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, you are really into that show."
1,6,Michael,You know something?
1,6,Michael,I feel better already.
1,6,Michael,Should we get back to work?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,The whole point is to stop thinking about work and start having fun.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, what should we do first?"
1,6,Michael,This is so interesting!
1,6,Michael,"I mean, there's no point to it."
1,6,Michael,The images on the screen relate to nothing.
1,6,Michael,"Some time passed, and then it was over."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's karaoke!
1,6,Michael,"Oh, let's do it again."
1,6,Janet,"Okay, my hands are heated to the ideal 105 degrees."
1,6,Janet,Who would like to go first?
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, what if I go first, and then perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and share some intimate aspects of his life?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Or what if while Janet massages Tahani, I massage Jianyu?"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,I adore the impressionists.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who's your favorite artist?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, Pitbull changed the game --"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area."
1,6,Michael,"Oh, man!"
1,6,Michael,I didn't even want that thing.
1,6,Michael,Why am I trying to win it?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because the machine says it's a prize.
1,6,Michael,How many tickets do I get?
1,6,Michael,Six?
1,6,Michael,Is that all?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, watch this."
1,6,Michael,Is that allowed?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not really.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,But it is a time-honored tradition.
1,6,Michael,Say no more.
1,6,Michael,I got it.
1,6,Michael,I got it.
1,6,Michael,You know something?
1,6,Michael,"As much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful."
1,6,Michael,Sometimes all you guys think about is how you can have the most fun.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Exactly!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was practically my mantra.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's up, dong bait?"
1,6,Brittany,Ha-ha.
1,6,Brittany,Drop everything you're doing.
1,6,Brittany,Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
1,6,Brittany,I got tickets.
1,6,Brittany,We are road-tripping.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I can't!"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog."
1,6,Brittany,"I'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts topless on a yacht like a boss?"
1,6,Brittany,Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a very good point.
1,6,Brittany,This is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.
1,6,Brittany,The booze is free there.
1,6,Brittany,Do I really need to keep going?
