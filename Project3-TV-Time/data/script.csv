1,1,Michael,Eleanor?
1,1,Michael,Come on in.
1,1,Michael,"Hi, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,I'm Michael.
1,1,Michael,How are you today?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm great.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks for asking.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, one question."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where am I?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Who are you, and what's going on?"
1,1,Michael,"Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead."
1,1,Michael,"Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have some questions.
1,1,Michael,Thought you might.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did I die?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't remember.
1,1,Michael,"Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition."
1,1,Michael,Are you sure you want to hear?
1,1,Michael,"All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot."
1,1,Michael,"You dropped a bottle of something called, ""Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One""."
1,1,Michael,"And when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oof.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's how I died?
1,1,Michael,"No, sorry, there's more."
1,1,Michael,"You were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it'd swept you right out into the street where you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called ""Engorge-ulate""."
1,1,Michael,"Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, that's I get it, thank you."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, okay, sorry."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, so who was right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I mean about all of this?
1,1,Michael,"Well, let's see."
1,1,Michael,"Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit."
1,1,Michael,"Jews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's Doug Forcett?
1,1,Michael,"Well, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s."
1,1,Michael,"One night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, ""Hey, what do you think happens after we die?"""
1,1,Michael,And Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct.
1,1,Michael,"I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing."
1,1,Michael,"That's him, actually, right up there."
1,1,Michael,He's pretty famous around here.
1,1,Michael,I'm very lucky to have that.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So maybe my biggest question.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, is this"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or
1,1,Michael,"Well, it's not the heaven-or-hell idea that you were raised on."
1,1,Michael,"But generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place."
1,1,Michael,You're in The Good Place.
1,1,Michael,"You're okay, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,You're in The Good Place.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's good."
1,1,Michael,Sure is.
1,1,Michael,"Okay, let's take a walk, shall we?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, did I have a purse?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm dead, right."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,1,Michael,"So, this is how it works."
1,1,Michael,The Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.
1,1,Michael,Each one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do all the neighborhoods look like this?
1,1,Michael,"No, every neighborhood is unique."
1,1,Michael,"Some have warm weather, some cold."
1,1,Michael,"Some are cities, some farmland."
1,1,Michael,"But in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
1,1,Michael,Yeah.
1,1,Michael,That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.
1,1,Michael,People love frozen yogurt.
1,1,Michael,I don't know what to tell you.
1,1,Michael,"You're gonna have a million more questions, I know."
1,1,Michael,"For right now, better grab a seat."
1,1,Michael,Movie's about to begin.
1,1,Michael,Ah.
1,1,Michael,"Hello, everyone."
1,1,Michael,And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
1,1,Michael,"You were all, simply put, good people."
1,1,Michael,But how do we know that you were good?
1,1,Michael,How are we sure?
1,1,Michael,"During your time on Earth, every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe."
1,1,Michael,"Every sandwich you ate, every time you bought a magazine, every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad."
1,1,Michael,You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?
1,1,Michael,"And they think to themselves, ""Ah, who cares? No one's watching."""
1,1,Michael,We were watching.
1,1,Michael,Surprise!
1,1,Michael,"Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system."
1,1,Michael,"Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to The Good Place."
1,1,Michael,"What happens to everyone else, you ask?"
1,1,Michael,Don't worry about it.
1,1,Michael,"The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived."
1,1,Michael,And you won't be alone.
1,1,Michael,Your true soulmate is here too.
1,1,Michael,That's right.
1,1,Michael,Soulmates are real.
1,1,Michael,"One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soulmate, and you will spend eternity together."
1,1,Michael,So welcome to eternal happiness.
1,1,Michael,Welcome to The Good Place.
1,1,Michael,Sponsored by  otters holding hands while they sleep.
1,1,Michael,You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands?
1,1,Michael,That's how you're gonna feel every day.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So who is in The Bad Place that would shock me?
1,1,Michael,"Uh well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every US president except Lincoln."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds about right.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about Florence Nightingale?
1,1,Michael,"It was close, but, no, she didn't make it."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe."
1,1,Michael,"Again, it's an incredibly selective system."
1,1,Michael,Most people don't make it here.
1,1,Michael,"But you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor."
1,1,Michael,"And by the way, welcome to your new home."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, it's perfect, isn't it?"
1,1,Michael,"You see, in The Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one."
1,1,Michael,Exactly.
1,1,Michael,"Oh, I'm so happy you get it."
1,1,Michael,"As you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style."
1,1,Michael,"Oh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I do love clowns.
1,1,Michael,"Now, let me show you the, uh, the video system here."
1,1,Michael,You can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
1,1,Michael,There we go.
1,1,Michael,This is your human rights mission to Ukraine.
1,1,Michael,"I mean, you got a ton of points for that one."
1,1,Michael,It really put you over the top.
1,1,Michael,Oh.
1,1,Michael,"Chidi, come on in."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soulmate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bring it in, man."
1,1,Michael,"Now, excuse me."
1,1,Michael,I have other people to attend to.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So where you from, Chidi?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Australia, Hong Kong, Paris."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What about you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Arizona.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your English is amazing.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I'm actually speaking French.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,This place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,So it's incredible.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,And now I want to say this.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-kay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,And now we can actually learn about them together as soulmates.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's overwhelming.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You'll stand by my side no matter what, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Of course I will.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Promise me.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Say, ""I promise I will never betray you for any reason."""
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because those aren't my memories.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wasn't a lawyer.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never went to the Ukraine.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I hate clowns.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's been a big mistake.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not supposed to be here.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, what?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Are you sure this isn't you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death-row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They got my name right, but nothing else."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, somebody royally forked up."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Somebody forked up.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why can't I say ""fork""?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"If you're trying to curse, you can't here."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's bull-shirt.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"So, if you're not this person, then who are you?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What did you do for a living?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was in sales.
1,1,Wallace,"So we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver."
1,1,Wallace,We aim this at seniors.
1,1,Wallace,"Now, you can't legally call it ""medicine"" because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I get it, man."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which one's my desk?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,So your job was to defraud the elderly
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, the sick and elderly?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I was very good at it.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was the top salesperson five years running.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, but that's worse."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you, you do get how that's worse, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, maybe it's a test."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Maybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't risk going to The Bad Place.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Let's just get some information first.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,We'll ask Janet.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, Janet?"
1,1,Janet,Hi there.
1,1,Janet,How can I help you?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
1,1,Janet,I'm Janet.
1,1,Janet,I'm the informational assistant here in The Good Place.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,She's like this walking database.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You can ask her about the creation of the universe, or history --"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,His name was Kevin Paltonic.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he gay?
1,1,Janet,No.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.
1,1,Janet,That's correct.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway."
1,1,Janet,"Yes, you were."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, Janet, I have a question."
1,1,Janet,Okay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What is The Bad Place like?
1,1,Janet,"Oh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about."
1,1,Janet,I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,1,Woman,The bear has two mouths!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it doesn't sound awesome."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does everyone have a huge house except me?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, we need a plan."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You must've told a few white lies in your life.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, what was your job?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mother-forker!
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I'm getting a stomachache.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm I have a stomachache."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,This is awful.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I, uh I think I have to tell Michael about this."
1,1,Michael,Tell Michael about what?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What have you been up to?
1,1,Michael,"Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu."
1,1,Michael,They are soulmates and your next-door neighbors.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I just say I love your house?
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just so tiny and cute.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,I love it.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just so sweet and teensy.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just like you.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Boop.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,1,Michael,Oh!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You booped me.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's fun.
1,1,Michael,"Tahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I simply adore entertaining."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?"
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see, and he obeys a strict code of silence."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Isn't that right, darling?"
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,So we'll see you tonight?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,My entire house could fit in this room.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, uh help me out here."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Tell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Let's forget about good.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, just tell me something neutral about yourself."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, tell me about the day before you died."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,What do you remember?
1,1,Joe,Hi there.
1,1,Joe,Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have a second to eat my farts?
1,1,Joe,You missed.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't remember anything specific.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Oh
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Look.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I might not have been a saint, but it's not like I killed anybody."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wasn't an arsonist.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All I'm saying is these people might be ""good"", but are they really that much better than me?"
1,1,Bambadjan,"Well, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights."
1,1,Gloria,"So we said, ""If the UN won't remove those land mines, we will."""
1,1,Gloria,And we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.
1,1,Sachveer,"Well, then he said, ""You can't give me both your kidneys, you'll die."""
1,1,Sachveer,"And I said, ""But you will live."""
1,1,Sachveer,"And I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, forget it."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Heading to the bar!
1,1,Michael,"Thank you, thank you."
1,1,Michael,You all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.
1,1,Michael,But what you don't know is
1,1,Michael,"Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um"
1,1,Michael,"Oh, what the heck?"
1,1,Michael,This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
1,1,Michael,"I have been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project."
1,1,Michael,Yes!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ah, ah, ah."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hold on there, ace."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me get more of them shrampies.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, easy."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They're for everybody, right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, exactly."
1,1,Michael,And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
1,1,Michael,That's it for me.
1,1,Michael,"Back to you, Tahani."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Bravo, Michael, bravo!"
1,1,Michael,Thank you.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Cheers.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, what a condescending bench."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, okay, okay, okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I right?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why does she still have that British accent, right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one else here has an accent.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's choosing to have that accent.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Oh, hello."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe."""
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, okay."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I think it's time to go home.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, wait, wait."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, don't do that."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Don't do no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, creepy house that I hate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, one million clowns."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why aren't there stairs here?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What kind of weirdo house is this?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Did you fill your bra with shrimp?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever, it's freakin' heaven."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At least I can still say ""butthead""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, she is a butthead."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Found some pajamas.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi Chidi, Chidi?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry that you had to deal with this
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's okay.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's not, though."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you think anybody cared that I died?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe someone did.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was an only child.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,My parents were divorced when I was a kid.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They were both crummy people, so they're probably in The Bad Place."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe they're being used to torture each other.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,It would work.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet way more people cared that you died.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause you're a nice person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Aganocomonga.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ags say it again.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye""."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, say what you said before."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,I did.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,It's Anagonye.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,You just changed it.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I didn't change it, it's my name."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Argrugande.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ariana Grande.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did it.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good night.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Good night.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's terrifying."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,That can't be good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork."
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,1,Michael,Hmm?
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there?"
1,1,Michael,Ah.
1,1,Michael,"Well, great question, Tahani."
1,1,Michael,No.
1,1,Michael,"No, it's not."
1,1,Michael,I have no idea why any of this is happening or how to control it.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Should we run away then?
1,1,Michael,Yes.
1,1,Tahani Al-Jamil,Righto.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, Chidi!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's going on?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are there giant animals everywhere?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,You're not.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,You're the only one who's not.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, this is all happening because of you."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork me."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't know this is because of me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hang on."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not everybody here is perfect, okay?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani is totally condescending.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And there are a couple of, you know, chunksters."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, come on!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No judgment.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,So how can we be sure this is my fault?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, then this system sucks."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was a medium person.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,I should get to spend eternity in a medium place!
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like Cincinnati.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, apparently it doesn't work that way."
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Unless there is something we can do.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Unless you could teach me.
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,Teach you what?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,How to be good.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That was your job, right?"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,A professor of ethics?
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one knew I was a problem when I arrived.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know I'm trying to say ""ash-hole"" and not ""ash-hole"", right?"
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"I got that, yes."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, give me a chance."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me earn my place here.
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
1,1,Michael,"Hey, guys!"
1,1,Michael,"Uh emergency neighborhood meeting, now!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We'll be right there, Michael!"
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My soul is in your hands, soulmate."
1,1,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's it gonna be?
1,1,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, stomachache."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know what to do here.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,This is a mess.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Morally speaking, this is a putrid, disgusting bowl of ethical soup."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, how about we just chill and go to the town meeting and talk it out after?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, how do I make that helper woman show up?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hello?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Front desk lady?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Magical slave robot?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Excuse me, Janet?"
1,2,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still not used to it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, Janet, I need"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Quick question, can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot mailman from your work computer?"
1,2,Janet,It is 100% confidential.
1,2,Janet,"No one can access what you ask me, including Michael."
1,2,Janet,"Now, what kind of pornography would you like to see?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, no, not porn."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I, um I need clothes, like yours and Chidi's with the stripes."
1,2,Janet,There you go.
1,2,Michael,"Everybody, everybody!"
1,2,Michael,"Gather round, please, thank you, thank you."
1,2,Michael,"Obviously, there's something very wrong with this neighborhood."
1,2,Michael,"We don't know what it is, how long it will last, or what caused it."
1,2,Michael,"What do we know, Janet?"
1,2,Janet,We know where it happened.
1,2,Janet,Here.
1,2,Michael,"Yes, thank you, Janet."
1,2,Michael,The chaos happened here.
1,2,Michael,"See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems."
1,2,Michael,One little flaw can lead to
1,2,Michael,"Well, it can lead to Gary over there."
1,2,Gary,"Hey, Gary."
1,2,Michael,"Hang in there, buddy."
1,2,Michael,"Boy, my armpits are leaking."
1,2,Michael,What is that called again?
1,2,Janet,Sweat.
1,2,Michael,"Right, right."
1,2,Michael,Still not used to being in a human body.
1,2,Michael,And what do you do with sweat?
1,2,Michael,"Do you lick it away, is that right?"
1,2,Janet,"No, you dab it with a cloth."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, right."
1,2,Michael,And then you lick the cloth?
1,2,Michael,That seems weirder.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look!
1,2,Michael,Okay.
1,2,Michael,That's a good sign.
1,2,Michael,It could mean that this is almost over.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, such a relief."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That was my first time as a fashion ""don't"", and I did not care for it."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, things are settling down outside."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think it's time to make me good, partner."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do we do it?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where did you get a chalkboard?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"It's The Good Place, you can get anything you want at any time."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you chose a chalkboard?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you reading?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,The Metaphysics of Morals by Immanuel Kant.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to duty.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's a book on how to act good.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, great!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you've decided to help me?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,There's a thousand questions.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Is there a moral imperative to help you?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do I have a greater obligation to my community?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"On that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's just wrong about my overall ""quality"" level."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Please, help me, man."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I swear I am worth it.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Tell me one fact that you know about me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, we spent the whole day together."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You must remember something.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What country am I from?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it racist if I say Africa?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, and Africa is not a country."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I am from Senegal.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do I have any siblings?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Where did I go to college?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Trick question.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You didn't.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I was literally a college professor.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Do you not remember one single thing about me?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, things have been nuts around here."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet you don't know anything about me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You were born in Phoenix.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You went to school in Tempe.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You're an only child.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Your favorite show is something called The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and your favorite book is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did you know all that?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I think you're wrong."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"What country am I from, again?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sensodyne.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That is a brand of toothpaste.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's your problem.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, names in the hat."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Time to pick a designated driver.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the loser is Betsy.
1,2,Betsy,"Wait, you never get picked, and you're always the one who draws the name."
1,2,Betsy,Let me see that.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no need.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys?"
1,2,Betsy,Give it to me.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For the record I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it."
1,2,Betsy,"If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Again, out of principle."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let it wash over you, Betsy."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is what integrity looks like.
1,2,Michael,"All right, everyone, let's get started."
1,2,Michael,Things have settled down.
1,2,Michael,Phew!
1,2,Michael,"So hopefully, we're off and running."
1,2,Michael,"Welcome to orientation, day two."
1,2,Michael,"Now, today we're gonna start with something that everyone has always wanted to do."
1,2,Michael,Flying.
1,2,Michael,"Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, sorry."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, Michael?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,If if I might?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,We thought perhaps some of us could volunteer to help clean up the debris.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"For those of you who don't know, my soulmate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in The Good Place."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's truly inspiring.
1,2,Michael,"Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, hurrah."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We need about, uh, 12 volunteers."
1,2,Michael,Oh!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Have fun, nerds."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll be soaring through the air like a forkin' bird.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor and I would love to help.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ah.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hurrah, hurrah."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yay.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You want to prove you're not selfish?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Here's the perfect test.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Which do you choose?
1,2,Janet,Have fun.
1,2,Man 1,Hey!
1,2,Man 2,"Oh, hey!"
1,2,Man 3,"Aw, yeah!"
1,2,Man 4,All right!
1,2,Jessica,Whoo!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, up there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably?"
1,2,Jessica,"Well, I wouldn't call it fun."
1,2,Jessica,"I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better."
1,2,Jessica,How's volunteer garbage pickup?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,About the same.
1,2,Jessica,Great!
1,2,Jessica,Whee!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's not really important.
1,2,Michael,Tahani!
1,2,Michael,How goes the cleaning?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, swimmingly, Michael."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
1,2,Michael,"Well, thank you."
1,2,Michael,That's very kind of you to say.
1,2,Michael,But it's also dead wrong.
1,2,Michael,This neighborhood is a disaster.
1,2,Michael,"See, I must have made a mistake somewhere."
1,2,Michael,"And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again."
1,2,Michael,"I'm trying to put a good face on uh, well, this face that I've constructed for myself."
1,2,Michael,"But the truth is, I I'm just miserable."
1,2,Michael,I have to go.
1,2,Michael,Thank you so much for your service.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Powerful people do not handle failure well.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Soulmate, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Should we say it at the same time?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,All right.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"One, two, three."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,We must help Michael.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, you sly devil."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you?"
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"All right, come on."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's go.
1,2,Antonio,"Oh, boy!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio!"
1,2,Gunnar,"Hey, Eleanor. Isn't this great?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, yeah."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor."
1,2,Antonio,"Us, too!"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys are so fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just relentlessly fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I keep thinking, ""When are they gonna stop being fun?"""
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the answer is never.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're never gonna stop.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've made some new friends.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,My area's almost garbage-free.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right?"
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that is a really tough question."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know?"
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,He he compared it to playing the flute.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"The more you practice, the more you improve."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Aristotle!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's my boy, right there."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,He was the best.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, most people agree he was the best one."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So it sounds to me like you are onboard the ""Help Eleanor"" train."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities, yes and no."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, no worries."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys."
1,2,Betsy,"Okay, Eleanor, reminder."
1,2,Betsy,"We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Got it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got off work early.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk."
1,2,Betsy,Someone else will do it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good call.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I can't believe they've managed to mix one million flavors together, and yet, somehow, I can taste each individual one."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's remarkable.
1,2,Michael,I got no-flavor.
1,2,Michael,"It's all I deserve, really."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
1,2,Michael,"Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up."
1,2,Michael,"I really do, but you don't understand."
1,2,Michael,This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
1,2,Michael,"It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a fraction of a degree off the whole neighborhood is compromised."
1,2,Michael,Whose dog is that?
1,2,Michael,"Guys, whose dog is that?"
1,2,Michael,Whose dog is that?
1,2,Michael,"See, this is one of those glitches I was talking about."
1,2,Michael,"Nice try, puppy!"
1,2,Michael,Phew!
1,2,Michael,That was a close one.
1,2,Pevita,Teacup!
1,2,Pevita,"Hey, have you seen my dog?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?
1,2,Janet,"Five more minutes, flyers!"
1,2,Janet,Five more minutes!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man, really?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, I'm finished with cleanup, and I'm ready to fly."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do I start?
1,2,Janet,Hop on the launch pad and conjure an image that brings you pure joy.
1,2,Janet,Some people think of their wedding day or favorite vacation spot.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,People puking on roller coasters.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,People puking on roller coasters.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's working!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ow!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm?"
1,2,Michael,"So here's the situation, Pevita."
1,2,Michael,I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
1,2,Michael,But I got her back.
1,2,Michael,Everything everything seems fine.
1,2,Pevita,"Teacup, thank goodness you're okay."
1,2,Michael,"Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog."
1,2,Michael,It feels no pain or joy or love.
1,2,Pevita,Teacup doesn't love me?
1,2,Michael,Oh!
1,2,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love."
1,2,Michael,Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more?
1,2,Michael,Because I can kick her right back into the sun and get you another one just like that.
1,2,Pevita,No!
1,2,Michael,"Oh, boy."
1,2,Michael,I'm making things worse.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, all right, that's all right."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Breathe.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Breathe.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you breathe?
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If you do, then just breathe 'cause everything's fine, Michael, it's fine."
1,2,Pevita,It's raining garbage.
1,2,Pevita,Run!
1,2,Michael,"No, no, no, I'm gonna run this way."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Before you say anything
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's it, I just don't want you to say anything."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What did you do?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nothing!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It just started raining trash out of nowhere for no reason at all.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, fine, fine."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But in my defense, there were only five minutes left in flying and I wanted to go flying."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,How is that a defense?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You made a bad choice.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I made a bad choice?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We could have literally been flying, and all you wanted to do was talk about morals."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, you're like the worst part of Superman."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,This is a relief.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I can stop my deliberations.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"You're a selfish person, and it is pointless to help you."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You are on your own.
1,2,Antonio,"Oh, man."
1,2,Antonio,"How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar?"
1,2,Gunnar,More cleaning up to do.
1,2,Antonio,It's a it's a dream come true.
1,2,Antonio,We're okay!
1,2,Antonio,You can't die here.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, I mean, even you have to admit, those guys are psycho."
1,2,Michael,I don't know what's happening to me.
1,2,Michael,"I mean, it's my duty to be calm and in control and I'm falling apart."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, Michael, you are a paragon of fortitude."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're a mountain of strength.
1,2,Michael,I'm not a mountain of strength.
1,2,Michael,I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Surely now you will say something.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Please, I'm begging you."
1,2,Michael,Oh.
1,2,Michael,"Yes, yes, I understand."
1,2,Michael,The strength is inside me.
1,2,Michael,It's been there all along.
1,2,Michael,"No, of course, I can overcome any obstacle."
1,2,Michael,"Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you."
1,2,Michael,I'm back.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,You did it.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, you have so much to teach me."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Maybe I should try to be silent, too."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No really, look."
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Here I go.
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was wonderful!
1,2,Tahani Al-Jamil,So cleansing.
1,2,Kirk,"Just water tonight, huh?"
1,2,Kirk,Designated driver?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, it sucks."
1,2,Kirk,I think it's awesome.
1,2,Kirk,"I mean, someone's got to do it, right?"
1,2,Kirk,I think it's a cool thing to do for people.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I meant I meant it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I actually prefer it to drinking.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Staying sober and knowing my friends will get home safe, that's my buzz."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys, good news and bad news."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,See that hot bartender over there?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The bad news is, it means I can't drive you guys home."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I did call a cab for you guys.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But they recognized my number, and they didn't want to come."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,So are we good here?
1,2,Betsy,"Eleanor, you have a very important choice to make."
1,2,Betsy,"If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I'm good with that."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll see you guys at work.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Peace!
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You, let's go."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did you know I was here?
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,I saw you from my window.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"That's where I live, by the way."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Not that you ever asked.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What are you doing?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I went to all the places where I dumped trash earlier and cleaned it up so it couldn't be traced back to me.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You're doing this because you feel bad.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore, because I told you that's not gonna happen."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio and the whole neighborhood."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I felt bad about what I did.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was a weird feeling.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not used to it.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Didn't love it.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I think you're capable of change."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,And I will help you try.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down."
1,2,Janet,Hi there.
1,2,Janet,I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.
1,2,Janet,Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did not tell you to do that.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You are loco, girlfriend."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I won't let you down starting now."
1,2,Michael,"Ah, Eleanor."
1,2,Michael,Good morning.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, do you know what the best part about this place is?"
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
1,2,Michael,"Oh, I'm so glad you noticed."
1,2,Michael,I was very proud of that.
1,2,Michael,One of the hardest problems I had to solve.
1,2,Michael,"Eleanor, I know what you did."
1,2,Michael,Cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself.
1,2,Michael,"I knew you were special, but this is proof."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I was just doing my part."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, and, um since I'm special, your words, I didn't get to fly."
1,2,Michael,I'm sorry.
1,2,Michael,"No, I've had to ban flying for 1,000 years."
1,2,Michael,Too many injuries.
1,2,Michael,"One resident hit a rotting turkey carcass at a 1,000 miles an hour."
1,2,Michael,It just exploded into this fireball of turkey flesh and bones and sinew.
1,2,Michael,"Anyway, enjoy your coffee."
1,2,Michael,And the cup.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,So I have moved out of my apartment officially and into your guest room.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,"Figured it would cause less suspicion and make things easier for our ""good person"" lessons."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, just FYI, I'm a very loud snorer."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I like to drip dry in the nude, so eyes to yourself, perv."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Fine.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Now you got a long way to go to pull this off.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,We're gonna have assignments and quizzes and papers.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,It's gonna be so much fun.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Remind me what I'm getting out of this again.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,You get to avoid eternal damnation.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah."
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I got you a present."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,Senegal.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's not a present.
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,That's just common decency.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it."
1,2,Chidi Anagonye,Good talk.
1,2,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Aw, shirt."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Aristotle was Plato's student."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And Aristotle believes that your character is voluntary, because it's just the result of your actions, which are under your control."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"For example, right now, you have made the insane choice to ignore the person who is literally trying to save you from eternal damnation."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I just are we sure we should be paying attention to these guys?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, who died and left Aristotle in charge of ethics?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Plato.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, coming!"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, we're just kissing."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And groping?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Tahani.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What brings you here?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I was just, uh, in the neighborhood."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Do you get it, Eleanor?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Because, you know, we're all in the same afterlife, so, you know, I'm always in the neighborhood."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you get it?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I do, and it's delightful."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, this is for you."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just a housewarming plant.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's a little reminder that if there's ever anything that you need, I am right next door."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could I possibly forget?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Have a great day, Tahani!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, all right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Welcome to the neighborhood.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Even though we all arrived here at the same time.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Here's some dirt I put in a bowl because I'm amazing.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Chidi."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a total con.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I see through her little act.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Her act of being a nice person who brings you gifts?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bingo.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I'll I'll remind you that you're trying to learn how to be a good person.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe you should return the favor and bring her something.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice and make friends and treat her with mutual respect?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's exactly what she wants me to do, Chidi."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wake up!
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"That, that's what everyone wants everyone to do."
1,3,Michael,"Hello, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,No frozen yogurt for you this morning?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, uh, no, just, uh, doing some reading."
1,3,Janet,"Ugh, been there, brother."
1,3,Janet,"Workin' hard or hardly workin', am I right?"
1,3,Janet,Hump day.
1,3,Michael,"Uh, sorry."
1,3,Michael,"Janet's functioning as my assistant, but she's a little stiff, so I've been trying to get her to be a little more casual and conversational."
1,3,Janet,I'll have what she's having.
1,3,Michael,It's a work in progress.
1,3,Michael,"Listen, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,I've been studying your file.
1,3,Michael,You're a very interesting case.
1,3,Michael,You essentially only did one thing while you were on Earth.
1,3,Michael,You thought and wrote about ethics.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I spent 18 years working on my manuscript called, Who We Are and Who We Are Not"
1,3,Michael,"Right. No, no, no."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Practical Ethics and Their Application in the Modern World; A Treatise on --
1,3,Michael,"Yes, yes, yes, that's the one."
1,3,Michael,That's the one.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Michael,I think you should experience new adventures.
1,3,Michael,"You know, do things that you haven't done on Earth, right?"
1,3,Michael,So why don't we meet tomorrow and try out some new hobbies.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, why not?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I'll see you guys tomorrow.
1,3,Janet,Not if I see you first.
1,3,Janet,Where's the beef?
1,3,Michael,I don't know.
1,3,Janet,Hump day.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, darling, look, it's Eleanor from next door."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he asleep?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yeah, there's really no way to tell."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on in.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"What brings you to our home, my dear?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift with a housewarming gift of my own."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fresh pears.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,So maybe it's a better gift.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's to say?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's so kind.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"However, in, um, Chinese culture, pears are actually a symbol of bad luck."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu, so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw these in the garbage."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But do come and sit down.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,We haven't even had a chance to discuss all of the mayhem in our neighborhood yet.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's so disconcerting.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think is causing it?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm sure I don't know."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we must keep our heads up.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going door-to-door to make sure that every single person in this entire neighborhood is keeping calm and carrying on."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Cause I think that helping others will make me feel like I truly belong here, you know?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Here's a brainstorm, why don't I go with you?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I would love to do my part to help the neighborhood, not to mention, get a little bonding time with you, lady."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hurrah!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What are you talking about?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,This note was slipped under my door yesterday.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It has to be Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She just said to me, ""I want to feel like I truly belong here."""
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, where have I seen the word ""belong"" recently?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah, kaplow!"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I really don't think she's the type of person who would write this.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She is that kind of person and she did write it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And now I'm complimenting her.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And kind of turned on.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, she straight up sucks, bro."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Typical Tahani.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brings us a faulty plant so she can brag about being a better gardener.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I think this is another way in which your negative actions affect this world."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"This plant represents your relationship to Tahani, so when you're mean to her, it starts to wilt."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, then this plant is doomed because tomorrow, I'm going with her and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone that she is secretly a two-faced, calculating, phony bench."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, all I want to do is just check in, see how everyone's holding up."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just bring some cheer to these extraordinary people.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, tell me about yourself."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The good, the bad, the really bad, the embarrassing, the humiliating, just let's bond."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, well I was born in Pakistan, raised in London, schooled in Paris, but I think the primary reason that I'm in The Good Place is that I raised quite a lot of money for non-profit groups."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Did you ever, uh, skim a little off the top for yourself?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Gracious, no, no!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Every penny was accounted for.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And as I raised nearly $60,000,000,000, there was quite a lot of pennies."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I also dabbled in some other professions.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was a model, a museum curator, an ""It Girl"", and oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was quite fun.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Modeling?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a crazy life.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Want to tell me about that rock bottom you probably hit?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I didn't really do it for long."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Couture just doesn't fit my body.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm cursed with ample bosom.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And yet you soldier on.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, this is silly"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So ""Tahani"" means ""congratulations"" in Arabic."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And ""Al-Jamil"" means ""beautiful"", so my full name altogether means"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Congratulations, Beautiful."""
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thanks, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,You big flirt.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, babe, got you coffee."
1,3,Samuel,"Oh, great."
1,3,Samuel,"Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh, we shouldn't go there."
1,3,Samuel,Everybody's boycotting.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I know that one guy found a scorpion in his latte."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't really care, though, 'cause it's so close to here."
1,3,Samuel,"No, no, no, it's because he's sexually harassing people."
1,3,Samuel,"Look, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him."
1,3,Samuel,"Here, watch."
1,3,Andy,"Here's the thing, sweetheart."
1,3,Andy,"You're very qualified, but you're also what we call in the coffee shop game a, uh, dog-face."
1,3,Andy,"You're a three, and you have to be a nine to work here."
1,3,Andy,It's just math.
1,3,Woman,"So, I didn't get the job?"
1,3,Andy,"No, dog-face, you didn't get the job."
1,3,Andy,"All right, I'll check your references."
1,3,Andy,Just to be nice --
1,3,Woman,"Hey, my breasts!"
1,3,Andy,I'll check 'em.
1,3,Andy,"Oh, they're good."
1,3,Andy,Honk!
1,3,Samuel,"I mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once."
1,3,Samuel,"No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there."
1,3,Samuel,We can get coffee somewhere else.
1,3,Andy,Did you know your left reference is a little bit bigger than your right reference?
1,3,Andy,"It's not a bad thing, it's just it's a thing."
1,3,Michael,"This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,Cartography.
1,3,Michael,Your neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.
1,3,Michael,"And you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I see how that might be fun.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I have what doctors call, ""directional insanity""."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I once got lost on an escalator.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, not exactly Christopher Columbus."
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, Columbus is in The Bad Place because of all the raping, slave trade and genocide."
1,3,Michael,The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly why you should do it.
1,3,Michael,"You know, get out of your comfort zone."
1,3,Michael,Become a trail-blazer.
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, all deceased members of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team are also in The Bad Place."
1,3,Michael,"Uh, yeah, sorry about this."
1,3,Michael,"I steered her away from colloquialisms and into ""fun facts"" and ""trivia tidbits""."
1,3,Michael,I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, a ""wheelhouse"" is a part of a boat."
1,3,Michael,"Okay, thank you, Janet, thank you."
1,3,Janet,"Fun fact, Janet is me."
1,3,Michael,"All right, let's forget about exploring."
1,3,Michael,Plenty more ideas for hobbies.
1,3,Michael,"Let's walk back to town, shall we?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Michael,Wrong way.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Yep.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, Glenn, we just wanted to make sure you were all right."
1,3,Glenn,"Tahani, you're too sweet."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,3,Glenn,Isn't she just the nicest person?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is what a lot of people are saying.
1,3,Glenn,"Oh, everyone I know is saying that."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, it's just a big neighborhood, full of enormous mansions and people who love Tahani!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor and I just want to see if there's anything we can do to help you.
1,3,Cualli,"Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful."
1,3,Cualli,"Despite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please take a maple butter scone.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I made them fresh this morning.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, they look a bit burned."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they're not.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, fork, that's good."
1,3,Michael,"Extra, extra!"
1,3,Michael,Read all about you.
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, this is the perfect hobby for you."
1,3,Michael,Journalism.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, obviously, I like to write."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,But I don't love deadlines.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I prefer to take my time with things.
1,3,Michael,"Yes, I know."
1,3,Michael,"Uh, you never even named your dog, did you?"
1,3,Michael,"When it ran away, you posted signs saying, ""Responds to long pauses."""
1,3,Michael,"Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to find you a hobby --"
1,3,Michael,The hat --
1,3,Michael,That will bring you a positive experience.
1,3,Michael,What do you say?
1,3,Janet,I'm loving that hat on you.
1,3,Janet,It would look even better on my floor.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What is happening now?
1,3,Michael,"I suggested she be friendlier, she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality."
1,3,Janet,I got something you can slip into.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Oh --
1,3,Michael,"Janet, no!"
1,3,Michael,"No, Janet."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That nod meant no, apparently."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,They all truly belong here.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, they do, cutie-pants. Boop!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I should really be going."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I have to begin my 12 step Korean skincare regiment, but, uh, I'll see -- oh, no, no, no."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please stay and enjoy the evening tea.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll see you soon.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Boop!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil."""
1,3,Michael,Okay.
1,3,Michael,Arc welding.
1,3,Michael,"You could learn sculpture, you can make furniture, you can get your hands a little greasy, you know, and you make things."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,This equipment is very scary!
1,3,Janet,Don't be a baby.
1,3,Janet,It can't hurt you.
1,3,Janet,"Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off."
1,3,Michael,Janet.
1,3,Janet,Whatever.
1,3,Janet,This whole thing is stupid.
1,3,Michael,"Oh, brother."
1,3,Michael,"I told her to be less flirty and now she's cruel and distant, apparently."
1,3,Michael,I just can't get this right.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you for trying to find me a new hobby.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, but I just want to be an academic."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I want to keep working on my manuscript.
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, here's the thing."
1,3,Michael,"See, I read your whole book, all 3,600 pages of it."
1,3,Michael,"It's, um how shall I put this?"
1,3,Janet,"It's a mess, dude."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
1,3,Michael,She's right.
1,3,Michael,"You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety of the world's literature in about an hour."
1,3,Michael,This took me two weeks to get through.
1,3,Michael,"I mean, it's so convoluted, I just keep reading the same paragraph over and over again, trying to figure out what the heck you were saying."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,3,Michael,"I mean, on page 1,000, you start section two with the sentence, ""Of course, the exact opposite might be true."""
1,3,Michael,"You're a brilliant guy, Chidi."
1,3,Michael,But you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.
1,3,Michael,I think you just twisted yourself up into a knot.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,I have a very bad stomachache.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Am I a good teacher?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Am I clear?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Do I make sense?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you're a great teacher."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm super ethical now.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,What's that?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nah, don't worry about it."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I stole Tahani's diary.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I could see if her handwriting matches the note and also read about all the mean and terrible things she's definitely done, so I can prove she's actually evil."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think that means?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,You stole Tahani's diary.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Why would you even know that?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,She wrote that note.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, she didn't!"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,You did!
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I was hoping you would come to this conclusion on your own, but, obviously, no one here would ever threaten you."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,That note is The Good Place manifesting your own guilt.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Like with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wrote myself the note.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And as it turns out, I do belong here."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because I'm just as good as everyone else.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"No, you don't belong here."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And in this place, everyone is better than you."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,It has been proven by an infallible formula.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Tahani might be a little British and condescending at times, but she devoted her entire life to helping other people."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,She's a good person.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Accept that.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, babe."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great news.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.
1,3,Samuel,Awesome!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, ooh, yikes."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Turns out two of the players have DUIs.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guess we can't cheer for that team.
1,3,Samuel,"Eleanor, I --"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Instead, let's just stay in, watch a Roman Polanski movie, listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-fil-A."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does that sound good?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There's bad stuff everywhere, man."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's impossible to avoid.
1,3,Samuel,"Yeah, but shouldn't we just try?"
1,3,Samuel,Shouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's so much harder to live like that.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it's not like someone's keeping score.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I know you're gonna break up with me, okay?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not an idiot.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I read your emails to your dad.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have fun being so amazing and perfect until you die.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And by the way, I'm talking really fast because I still go to Andy's Coffee, and I got a full punch card, bro."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good people make me insecure.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I'm around someone who I think is better than me, I try and drag them down to my level."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why perfect Tahani is like my kryptonite.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, even admitting that is an important step."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"And also, maybe don't listen to me."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I would love not to listen to you.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, what?"
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"Basically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Even Michael couldn't understand it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,So?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does Michael know?
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Everything.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"That's my point, he knows everything, and it was too convoluted, even for him."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael does not know everything.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael does not know I'm not supposed to be here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most complicated subjects in the world."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I used to get bored halfway through writing a text message."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be proud.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"I want to broaden my horizons and try new things, and I will."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"But even though I might have gotten lost in the weeds, I loved writing this book."
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,And I want to try again.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,"So, will you be my advisor?"
1,3,Michael,"Chidi, all I want is for you to be happy."
1,3,Michael,"So if spending eternity getting blunt feedback on your circular, rambling ideas will make you happy, then of course I will be your advisor."
1,3,Michael,Let's throw that monstrosity in the trash and start over.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Aren't there maybe some parts worth salvaging?
1,3,Michael,"Honestly, man, I don't even know."
1,3,Michael,"I mean, that thing is unreadable."
1,3,Michael,I literally learned what headaches were because that thing gave me a headache.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,3,Michael,There you go.
1,3,Michael,New beginnings!
1,3,Michael,Well done.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, Eleanor."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hi.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, I was just cleaning up."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you want to talk about it?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Desperately.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's Jianyu.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just can't seem to connect with him.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I know that he took a vow of silence, but he won't even talk to me, his soul mate!"
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I adore talking.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You do.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well I may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you deserve to be happy, because you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not to mention you have a rockin' bod.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, Jianyu may be mute, but he's not blind."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You two belong here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you belong together.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you have all of eternity, so there's plenty of time for things to change."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, thank you."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,I really needed to hear that.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, of course your hugs are amazing."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stupid ledge.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,No stairs.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everyone here is really into hugging.
1,3,Chidi Anagonye,Looks like someone learned something.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it's 'cause someone else is a really good teacher."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, hello."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"How are you, my dear, sweet bestie?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Never better.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's up?
1,3,Michael,"Well, Janet has been acting as my assistant."
1,3,Michael,It's not what she was designed to do.
1,3,Michael,Didn't go great.
1,3,Janet,But now I'm back to normal.
1,3,Janet,It turns out that the best Janet was the Janet that was inside Janet all along.
1,3,Michael,"She was feeling a little lost, so I gave her a self-help book to restore her confidence."
1,3,Janet,Now I'm living my truth and creating my bliss.
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, um, look, Michael asked me if I would serve as his assistant, but I'd quite like to focus on my relationship with Jianyu."
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,So I recommended you for the job.
1,3,Michael,"Eleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood."
1,3,Michael,Will you help me?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could I say no?
1,3,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yeah, hurrah!"
1,3,Janet,Hurrah!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What now?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Relax, Eleanor."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sent this to yourself.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is your own guilt manifesting itself.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,I've been waiting for you.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jianyu?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You talk now?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sent me these threatening notes?
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the fork, man?"
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Some Buddhist monk you are.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,You don't belong here.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,Admit it.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, you're right."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't belong here.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael made a mistake.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I'm trying, dude."
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm really trying to be a good person.
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I think I'm changing for the better, so just please, please don't rat me out."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"Don't worry, I won't."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"Because I'm not supposed to be here, either."
1,3,Jason Mendoza,"I don't know how I got here, I have no idea what's going on, and I am freakin' out, homie!"
1,3,Jason Mendoza,You got to help me.
1,3,Jason Mendoza,I'm scared!
1,3,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hang on, hang on you're not supposed to be here either?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a mistake, just like me?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"There's so much thoughts in my brain, it's like my head is filled with rocks."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,How have you managed to stay undiscovered?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because I have had to dodge and weave and barely escape with my life, and you don't seem like a super genius."
1,4,Michael,"Hello, Jianyu."
1,4,Michael,I'm Michael.
1,4,Michael,"Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence."
1,4,Michael,Would you prefer to remain silent here as well?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You literally haven't said a word since we got here?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"When I say I'm meditating, I'm just trying to figure out what the fork is happening."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I think we might be in an alien zoo or on a prank show.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Jianyu, we're dead."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, that's a dope prank."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Got to give it up.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is your real name Jianyu?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It's Jason Mendoza.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"And by the way, everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm Filipino.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,That's racist.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Heaven is so racist.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,But Tahani said that you helped Michael by putting your hand on his chest and doing some sort of healing magic.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm from Jacksonville, Florida."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It happens a lot.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What did you do for a living?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Electronic dance music.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I was also an amateur hip-hop backup dancer, an amateur body spray inventor um, I did pranks on Vine."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,None of those are jobs.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What did you do to make money?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, here's my biggest question, how did you know that I didn't belong here?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I heard you don't talk.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, here's something for you to not talk about."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't belong here.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,They made a mistake.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Total phony.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,So
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, later, man."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I vaguely remember that.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I believe you, Jason."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not supposed to be here.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
1,4,Michael,"Hello, Tahani."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, Michael."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was just picking out some fresh orchids for my nightly orchid bath.
1,4,Michael,"So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents is opening a new restaurant tonight."
1,4,Michael,This neighborhood could use a real morale boost.
1,4,Michael,"And since you're an expert at event planning, I was hoping that you would help with the grand opening."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Michael, say no more."
1,4,Michael,I wasn't going to.
1,4,Michael,I was done.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, good, because, of course, I will."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
1,4,Janet,"Hey, there."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, darling."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I would like to model tonight's event on my most successful gala.
1,4,Janet,That would be 2006 fundraiser for stem cell research in Barcelona.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Barcelona"", actually."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, it was a perfect evening."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Princess Stephanie was there, as were Posh and Becks."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, International Sophisticate Magazine gave us five Gwyneths."
1,4,Michael,"Tonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders."
1,4,Michael,It's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, good luck."
1,4,Michael,Thank you.
1,4,Michael,"Yes, yes."
1,4,Michael,I'm excited.
1,4,Michael,And a little nervous.
1,4,Michael,I'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.
1,4,Michael,I hope I don't chicken out at the last second.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry we are talking about suspenders, right?"
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like these?
1,4,Michael,You can do that with oh!
1,4,Michael,I cannot wait.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excellent.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Tahani has no idea about me?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"She thinks I'm a monk, and she thinks you're her best friend."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, for us."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a huge bummer for her.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need someplace that we can talk in private.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I agree.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Let me show you my bud-hole.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I should warn you, it's a little messy."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,This is my bud-hole.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"It's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, bud-hole!"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, now I get it."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I wrote down on a piece of paper that I needed a private meditation area.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Tahani will never come in.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Pretty unique decorating style you have here, Jianyu."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, ""12-year-old boy"" meets ""13-year-old boy""."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Thanks.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Janet helped me get all this stuff.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,She rules.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Is she single, or is she married to Michael?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A, she's not human."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And B, you have to keep pretending to be Tahani's soul-mate."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, just sit tight, dude."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have a class to get to.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,What a class?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I didn't know there were classes.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi is trying to teach me to be a good person.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it's really hard.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My whole situation here is getting more and more dicey, so I'm actually really glad to have a place I can come when I just want to be myself."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I miss being myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Myself was the best.
1,4,AcidCat,"What's up, man?"
1,4,AcidCat,You're Jason?
1,4,AcidCat,You got two minutes.
1,4,AcidCat,Fred Durst is throwing an orgy on a partially capsized yacht.
1,4,AcidCat,My dad just texted.
1,4,AcidCat,It already started.
1,4,AcidCat,So I'll get right to the point.
1,4,AcidCat,I listened to your demo.
1,4,AcidCat,You're terrible.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Really?
1,4,AcidCat,Yeah.
1,4,AcidCat,Okay?
1,4,AcidCat,You just don't have any what's the word?
1,4,AcidCat,Talent.
1,4,AcidCat,But don't worry.
1,4,AcidCat,"You got something better than talent, man."
1,4,AcidCat,You got my approximate size and weight.
1,4,AcidCat,"I'm supposed to play this club for the rest of the week, but I just got an offer to DJ Scott Disick's after party for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Whoa, congrats, bro."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,That's the dream.
1,4,AcidCat,"It's your dream, man."
1,4,AcidCat,It's my Tuesday.
1,4,AcidCat,I just need somebody to fill in.
1,4,AcidCat,Put on the helmet.
1,4,AcidCat,Press spacebar on the computer.
1,4,AcidCat,Those idiots won't know the difference.
1,4,AcidCat,"For the next week, Jason, you are Acidcat."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Whoa.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,There's a lot of old gum in here.
1,4,Chef Patricia,"Tahani, how are things going in the front of the house?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,"Because, to be perfectly frank, things in the kitchen are going great, okay?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,I am right on schedule.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked every single detail."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Your restaurant opening is going to be the talk of the entire neighborhood.
1,4,Chef Patricia,Thank you for your thoughtfulness and hard work.
1,4,Chef Patricia,I could not have done this without you.
1,4,Michael,"Ah, hello, Tahani."
1,4,Michael,Sorry.
1,4,Michael,I should've warned you.
1,4,Michael,"Patricia is actually very happy, but she's also very intense."
1,4,Michael,It can be confusing.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no, no, that's not what's bothering me."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited."
1,4,Michael,Right.
1,4,Michael,"Jianyu is a beautiful spirit, but he literally doesn't talk, and since this will be an evening of lively conversation, and you'll be busy working, I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I totally understand.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well reasoned, Michael."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As us Brits are fond of saying, ""Try your best to hide your sadness."""
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"So, the concept of the self is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu wrote, ""Knowing others is wisdom, but knowing the self is enlightenment."""
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ah ""knowing"" yourself."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he talking about what I think he's talking about?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, Eleanor."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"You read this, right?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I tried to."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I tried to want to."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Mm, actually, could we postpone this lesson?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've befriended Jianyu from next door, and I thought I could learn from him."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,That's a great idea.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Hume's ""bundle theory"" of the self is fairly close to Buddhism."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,No durr.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why I'm doing it.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Do you hear music?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's not music.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's EDM.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you doing?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Eleanor, you were right."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No more pretending.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It's time for me to be myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"What's up, homie?"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You broke Jianyu.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, did we miss anything?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Take that jersey off, you goofball."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is not my fault.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I swear.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But here's the thing, Jianyu is actually a guy who is nice."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Tahani."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't mind me.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm just dropping off my afternoon gloves, and picking up my early evening gloves."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"How are you, soul-mate?"
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm cool.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Am I going mad, or did I just hear you say, ""I'm cool""?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mm.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mm-hmm.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think so.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think that happened.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you're wrong."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I see what's going on here.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,You've got a whisper in your snicker box.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're both helping Jianyu to regain his confidence to be able to speak again as a surprise for me!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, busted."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,My heart is soaring.
1,4,Michael,"So, Jianyu is talking?"
1,4,Michael,"Oh, how wonderful!"
1,4,Michael,I will do everything in my power to encourage him.
1,4,Michael,"Well, not everything."
1,4,Michael,I won't give him a second mouth.
1,4,Michael,Unless that would be helpful.
1,4,Michael,No.
1,4,Michael,Better not risk it.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've actually had a better idea.
1,4,Michael,Oh.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi and Eleanor have been working with him, and they're going to be here."
1,4,Michael,What a great idea.
1,4,Michael,Patricia!
1,4,Michael,"We can fit another chair, right?"
1,4,Chef Patricia,Change the floor plan an hour before opening?
1,4,Chef Patricia,Of course!
1,4,Chef Patricia,The more the merrier!
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hurrah!"
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I knew tonight was going to be perfect, but now it's going to be even perfect-er."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Obviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect"
1,4,Michael,"Well, it isn't, actually."
1,4,Michael,Any place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.
1,4,Michael,That's how you got Beyonce.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Oh bud-hole.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay now, tell me everything."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Jianyu is a fraud, just like me."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,His real name is Jason.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's gonna be fine.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We just need a plan.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I got a plan."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"We hack into Michael's phone, download all his nudes, and then blackmail him."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you no.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, you should listen to me."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I came up with hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me killed."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, be quiet."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are not Jason.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are a monk named Jianyu.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Got it?
1,4,Pillboi,"Oh, another great set, Jason."
1,4,Pillboi,"They love you, dude."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"They don't love me, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,They love Acidcat.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,These cheers are fake.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,They hit my ears like boxing gloves of sadness.
1,4,Pillboi,"Oh, that's some poetic thoughts, B."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I got to be myself.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Attention, Jacksonville."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm not Acidcat.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm Mr. Music, the DJ."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"And this is a Mr. Music, the DJ original."
1,4,Michael,Welcome to the opening of The Good Plates.
1,4,Michael,I just got that.
1,4,Michael,That's hilarious!
1,4,Michael,"Anyway, at some point or another, every resident in this neighborhood will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose."
1,4,Michael,Chef Patricia has done that tonight by opening this restaurant.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Now if you'd all like to take a look at tonight's menus
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's right.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"With Michael's help, Chef Patricia has recreated each person's favorite meal on Earth."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fun!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,It's my Grandmother's maafe.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Fresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Almost makes me forget how miserable I am right now.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You want to try a bite?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fish and peanut butter?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Tofu?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Imma order some jalapeno poppers.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be quiet and eat your white sponge.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
1,4,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't get a meal.
1,4,Janet,"According to our files, your favorite meal was the hunger strike you went on to protest Bolivian sex trafficking."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, right."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course I did that.
1,4,Michael,"Tahani, great party."
1,4,Michael,Check it out.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,4,Michael,Suspenders!
1,4,Michael,So dumb.
1,4,Michael,So much dumber than belts.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, congratulations, Michael."
1,4,Michael,How's Jianyu doing?
1,4,Michael,Is he opening up?
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Mm, not yet."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I can tell he wants to.
1,4,Michael,Don't worry.
1,4,Michael,I've got a plan.
1,4,Michael,"May I have your attention, please?"
1,4,Michael,"Later this evening, we will be enjoying Chef Patricia's delicious dessert, a stunning three-tiered cake that took her a full week to complete."
1,4,Michael,"But first, I'd like to try something fun."
1,4,Michael,Each one of you has a very special memory attached to the meal you're eating.
1,4,Michael,Why don't we go around the room and share our stories?
1,4,Glenn,"I'll start, Michael."
1,4,Glenn,"One day, I wasn't feeling so great, so I made myself a bowl of this chicken soup"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When it gets to you, say something short and boring about tofu."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which is?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Wings were free for ladies if they took their top off.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, a word?"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,4,Glenn,"Anyway, that's how this simple soup saved over 10,000 lives."
1,4,Michael,Ah!
1,4,Michael,Fabulous!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Jianyu starts talking about topless Buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed."
1,4,Michael,"Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence at the age of eight and hasn't spoken since, is ready to share with us."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need a distraction.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right the fork now!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no, no, no."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Chef Patricia poured her heart and soul into this.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Destroying it would be a truly cruel act.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no durr."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no!"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
1,4,Michael,Sinkhole!
1,4,Michael,Everyone out!
1,4,Michael,There's a sinkhole!
1,4,Michael,Glenn!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,You broke the world.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,It's not a compliment!
1,4,Michael,"Glenn, stay calm."
1,4,Michael,We're gonna get you out of there.
1,4,Michael,And we'll put your soup in the fridge so it won't go to waste.
1,4,Michael,"I know that may not be your number one concern right now, but"
1,4,Glenn,It was up there.
1,4,Glenn,It's real good soup.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You okay?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I was just to tell an awesome story about a wing-eating contest that I lost, and a barfing contest that I won, but then a hole opened up in the ground."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I made the hole to save you from yourself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You cannot let people know who you really are.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It would be very, very bad."
1,4,Pillboi,"Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville."
1,4,Pillboi,"What's wrong, dog?"
1,4,Pillboi,You look like you're freaking out.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Things are bad, Pillboi."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Acidcat is suing me for ""bleach of contract""."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I should have never pretended to be someone else.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,It could cost me all my dreams in life.
1,4,Pillboi,You got dreams in life?
1,4,Pillboi,That's lit.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Of course I have dreams, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I don't want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa, even."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I want it all.
1,4,Pillboi,"That's big goals, man."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"I know, but I believe in myself."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Someday, the world will see what I already know, that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Hand me the thing that blows it up.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, I hereby tender my resignation."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can no longer in good conscience coordinate any further events in The Good Place.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, I am turning in my evening gloves."
1,4,Michael,Tahani --
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't try to make me feel better.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,The launch was a disaster.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Poor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,My hair is barely cascading down my shoulders.
1,4,Michael,"Tahani, please."
1,4,Michael,"I know your journey with Jianyu has been frustrating, but your situation is actually very typical."
1,4,Michael,Soul mates sometimes take months to really click.
1,4,Michael,You have to be patient.
1,4,Michael,"And if anyone should take blame for the restaurant disaster, it's me."
1,4,Michael,I thought this neighborhood's troubles were behind us.
1,4,Michael,Now I fear the worst.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,We must keep the neighborhood together.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,What can I do?
1,4,Michael,"Oh, well, the sinkhole should be repairing itself in about three days."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, as soon as it does, we shall re-launch the restaurant."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll hang posters to get the word out, and in the meantime, I'll host a brunch party every morning to lift people's spirits."
1,4,Michael,Ah!
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,"While you repair the universe, I shall prepare the eggs."
1,4,Michael,"Oh, fanciful wordplay."
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,Indeed.
1,4,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is the Tahani that you know and love.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,So what do we do here?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's nothing to do.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's hopeless.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"I can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"I will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"And if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"No, I'm good."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, Chidi is giving you a lifeline right now, and you need to take it because you suck."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,You suck!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know!
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I'm trying to tell you.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,We both suck.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know who doesn't suck?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I didn't get into heaven to go to school.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You didn't get into heaven at all, shirt-for-brains."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I just want to be myself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's a very, very bad idea."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do not be yourself.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You need to be a better version of yourself, okay?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I do too.
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And our only hope right now is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,Think about that.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Do you have to call me a nerd so much?
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I said a lot of other nice things, okay?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Toughen up, nerd."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let's get crackin', Teach."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, that's really impressive."
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, where's Jianyu?"
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, I don't even know if he's coming."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I am here to learn about ethnics.
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,Wow!
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"That's great, man!"
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, I mean it's ethics but that's great."
1,4,Jason Mendoza,"Pretty sure it's ""ethnics""."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy, I'm proud of you."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is your first step towards not sucking.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,I just have two questions.
1,4,Jason Mendoza,When are football tryouts?
1,4,Jason Mendoza,And does this school have a prom?
1,4,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow."
1,4,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For the first time ever, I'm the smartest kid in class."
1,5,Janet,"Good afternoon, Eleanor."
1,5,Janet,What can I get you today?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lot of new flavors.
1,5,Janet,"Michael felt bad about the sinkhole, so he wanted to give you all a little treat."
1,5,Janet,"I recommend ""Full Cell Phone Battery""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I'm so relaxed."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they all look good.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,This might take me a while.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, Gunnar, why don't you go ahead?"
1,5,Gunnar,"Thanks so much, Eleanor."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Janet,"What can I get you, Gunnar?"
1,5,Gunnar,"Hi, Janet."
1,5,Gunnar,Can I have some Folded Laundry?
1,5,Janet,Coming up.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'll never believe it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, ""Why don't you go ahead?"""
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just like that!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Why don't you go ahead?"""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Okay
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you don't understand!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But now, thanks to your ""good person"" lessons, I didn't hold up the line."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't even try a dozen samples I didn't want just to spite some jerk who told me I was holding up the line.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You do that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Chidi, I used to do that."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now I do selfless things without even thinking about it.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,That's great.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I'm I'm proud of you.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,So where's our yogurt?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I forgot it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh can you go?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't want to go all the way back.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I ran all the way here and it was so hot.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good person.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"So, to sum up, Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I like this one.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's simple.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh screw all the other complicated theories, why didn't you start with this one?"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, but here's the problem."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"If all that matters is the sum total of ""goodness"", then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive war"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dude, I get it."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"It's like, I knew this girl Sheila she was a black market alligator dealer with a pierced jawbone."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Um okay, what?"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,"Sheila was gonna get married to my boy, Donkey Doug and make him move to Sarasota."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,It would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,I framed one innocent gator dealer to save a 60-person dance crew.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Shockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Well done.
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Thanks!
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Um
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yes, Jianyu?"
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Can I be excused?
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to get there before all the mini-waffles run out.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Go ahead, man."
1,5,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you want to roll right into another lesson?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I am revved up to learn, man."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,My brain is horny!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Um can we take a little break?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah, I get it."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of dharma."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with ""Interestingly"""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, I'll do that and, uh we can start another lesson."
1,5,Michael,Ah!
1,5,Michael,Tahani.
1,5,Michael,I've been working on my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.
1,5,Michael,Tell me what you think.
1,5,Michael,That New Yorker article was crazy.
1,5,Michael,You haven't seen Hamilton?
1,5,Michael,"Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Very well done, Michael."
1,5,Janet,"Hi, there!"
1,5,Janet,We have a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis.
1,5,Michael,A Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
1,5,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, what is a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?"
1,5,Michael,"It's nothing, it's a tiny little inconvenience."
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear?"
1,5,Janet,It appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.
1,5,Michael,"This is very bad, Janet."
1,5,Michael,We have to go into the sinkhole and fix it by hand.
1,5,Michael,Get the tools.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, can I be of any service?"
1,5,Michael,Ah!
1,5,Michael,Tahani.
1,5,Michael,Didn't see you there.
1,5,Michael,"Uh, no, no."
1,5,Michael,We're just having a slight problem with the enormous sinkhole.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, I meant to tell you I walked past it last night and I I actually saw it get a little bit bigger."
1,5,Michael,It got bigger?
1,5,Michael,"Ah, well, that's so normal."
1,5,Michael,Uh this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.
1,5,Michael,"I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Finally!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's get back to it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whip out that chalkboard, big boy, show me what you're working with."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, I was going to head into town and pick up some blankets."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Great, I'll grab my sweater."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can practice letting people cut in front of me.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, uh, I just realized that I have blankets, so I'm going to take a nap using the several blankets that I already have."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Good night.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Out with it.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Fine, I'm just tired, need a break."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,No big deal.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,The way you're talking to me right now?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Everything's cool, no big deal"", I know that move."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I told a boyfriend something was ""no big deal"", it meant anything from ""I just bought weed from your nephew"", to ""I secretly befriended your ex-girlfriend last year, things got out of hand, and now I'm her bridesmaid""."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, well, in this case, it really is no big deal."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you're hiding something!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is wrong?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, 2nd."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well done, my love."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,So where am I?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, 6th?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm second to last.
1,5,Young Tahani,"Mummy, I made you this."
1,5,Young Tahani,It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Thank you, Tahani."
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,It's very competent.
1,5,Young Kamilah,"I made a bird, as well."
1,5,Young Kamilah,"I worked in a reflective alloy, holding up a mirror to mankind and its mistreatment of these defenseless animals."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Excellent, Kamilah."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,I sense the influence of Brancusi and Kapoor.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,"It seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction."
1,5,Young Kamilah,"Good eye, Mother."
1,5,Young Kamilah,I grew tired of objective representation.
1,5,Young Kamilah,I trust my audience.
1,5,Young Tahani,My birdie has a hat.
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Yes, well done, Tahani."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Nothing's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Would you stop doing that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, fine!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You want to know what's wrong?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You are a full-time job.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I wake up, there's Eleanor."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I spend all day teaching Eleanor.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And then it's, ""Good night, Eleanor."""
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, this is a nice dream, my grandma's here."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, she's got Eleanor's face!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,And tentacles for some reason.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought you liked teaching me.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So now I'm just some huge burden for you?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Yes!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Of course you are!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I am in paradise!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I should be doing paradise things, like rowing out on a lake with a good bottle of wine, reading French poetry."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's your idea of paradise?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, and I can't stop helping you, because then I am shirking my ethical duty."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,It's an impossible position!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, if you're so stressed from writing on a chalkboard, why don't you just leave?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We could pretend to be soul mates in public, but other than that, we don't have to see each other!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Fine with me!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I'll move out right now.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine!
1,5,Michael,Good afternoon.
1,5,Michael,"As you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center."
1,5,Michael,"The situation, sadly, has worsened."
1,5,Michael,"Starting right now, no one may go outside under any circumstances."
1,5,Michael,"Leaving your homes could result in catastrophic damage, to you and to the very fabric of the universe."
1,5,Michael,"Okay, bye."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or we could both just stay here.
1,5,Michael,We hope you enjoy your eternal stay in The Good Place.
1,5,Michael,"Take advantage of our day spa, or Janet a magical assistant who can get you whatever you want."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You mind turning that off?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,It's been playing on a loop for two days.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,The whole Neighborhood is offline.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We only get the welcome channel.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What have you done to me, you monster?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Look at all these dishes piling up.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I did that.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I cleaned the dishes.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then what's up with these bad boys?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,You are unbelievable.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you still upset?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not over it yet?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,How can I be over it?
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice ""vacation"" from your ""full-time job""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Get your story straight, bro!"
1,5,Michael,"Hey, guys, it's Michael."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise."
1,5,Michael,"Oh, I'd love to make small talk."
1,5,Michael,"I've been practicing, too."
1,5,Michael,"I'm amazing at it, but I'm in a bit of a rush here."
1,5,Michael,This is Bart and Nina.
1,5,Michael,"They live right next door to the, uh, sinkhole, so they obviously need a place to stay."
1,5,Michael,"I was wondering, as my assistant, maybe you could put them up for a while?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, of course."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't think twice.
1,5,Michael,"Okay, shouldn't take long."
1,5,Michael,"Between an hour and, um, 11 months."
1,5,Michael,Somewhere in there.
1,5,Michael,"Okay, bye."
1,5,Michael,Don't go outside.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to day three of our brunch siege."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I stayed up all night to plan a full day of fun activities.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just check the schedule I made.
1,5,Henriette,"Tahani, you are truly the best."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, you would think so, wouldn't you, Henriette?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Still second to last.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,Tahani!
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,This auction threatens to be an embarrassing failure.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,5.2 million isn't bad.
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,"It's very ""middle-thermometer""."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,Your public failure is our public failure.
1,5,Manisha Al-Jamil,You know what has to be done.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm very pleased to announce that there has been an addition to today's docket.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamilah.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person ever to graduate from Oxford University."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"She's a world-class painter, social activist, iconoclast, Olympic gold medalist for archery, a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary on her Grammy Award-winning album, and the person voted ""Most Likely to be Banksy""."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So without further ado, take it away from me!"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah."
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"The bidding shall commence at 3,000,000."
1,5,Waqas Al-Jamil,Five million!
1,5,Nina,Thank you guys so much.
1,5,Nina,Sorry for the imposition.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh bah!
1,5,Bart,"Oh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you."
1,5,Bart,We are obsessed with your relationship.
1,5,Bart,"Always whispering, locking yourself in the house all day."
1,5,Nina,I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job.
1,5,Nina,But I have a lot to learn from you guys.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your job?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What was your job?
1,5,Nina,I was a marriage counselor.
1,5,Nina,You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.
1,5,Nina,And I did!
1,5,Nina,"It's called, How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From a 100 Miles Away."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, cool."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, cool."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really cool.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Really, really cool."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Cool, cool."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And what about you, Bart?"
1,5,Bart,"Oh, well, my job wasn't nearly as interesting."
1,5,Bart,I started a company that investigated identity theft.
1,5,Bart,"Analyzing body language, tracking and catching people pretending to be someone they're not."
1,5,Bart,"It's snooze, am I right?"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,They're gonna catch us!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,This is an extremely precarious situation!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"I am vexed, Eleanor!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they have no reason to suspect us!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we do it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It'll get 'em to stop asking questions.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I I am not going to have sex with someone to get them to stop talking to me!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and I are very different.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I noticed!"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, man?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I have spent every second in this place worried I was gonna get caught, but if we go down right now, that's on you, okay?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you spend all your time teaching a charming, awesome lady?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,How sad for you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Face it, dude."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because guess what, Chidi?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya basic!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like, ""Whoa! This is hot,"" and we start making out."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dream on!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"No, Eleanor, look."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So how much of that did you hear?
1,5,Bart,"We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear you are in conflict."
1,5,Nina,We're not judging you.
1,5,Nina,This has been a tough couple of weeks.
1,5,Nina,I'm sure the stress of the sinkhole has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, that's what it is."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,A squabble.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're squabbling.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Squabble, squabble!"
1,5,Nina,I can help.
1,5,Nina,I'm gonna take your relationship and put it under a microscope and dig and poke and prod until you are back to soul mate harmony.
1,5,Nina,"Eleanor, why don't you --"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,She never does the dishes.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I have to do them all the time.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,We just have different interests.
1,5,Nina,Mmm-hmm.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I like relaxing, he likes getting on my case about the dishes."
1,5,Bart,I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.
1,5,Bart,"I suspected this when I arrived, but now I'm sure."
1,5,Bart,You are hiding something.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,What on Earth would I be --
1,5,Bart,"No, no, no, not you."
1,5,Bart,Him.
1,5,Michael,Please go back inside.
1,5,Michael,It isn't safe to be out of your home.
1,5,Michael,Please go back inside.
1,5,Michael,"Janet, could you see what's wrong?"
1,5,Janet,Everything.
1,5,Michael,Oh
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,My goodness!
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's even worse than I thought.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, what're you doing here?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, everyone else might be okay staying inside, but I wanted to help."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,So I've brought some cheer and sustenance to raise your spirits.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I made donut holes."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you get it?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Donut holes""?"
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sinkhole.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Funny, no?"
1,5,Janet,"No, too soon."
1,5,Janet,By exactly nine days.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous."
1,5,Michael,"If a human gets too close to it, there could be disastrous side effects."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's what's happening to me?
1,5,Michael,"Oh, that's one of the side effects."
1,5,Michael,"Janet, knock her out while we still have time."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Knock me out?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,What does that --
1,5,Janet,Boop!
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"Guys, really, it's no big deal."
1,5,Nina,"""It's not a big deal"" is nearly always code for ""something is wrong""."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Boom!
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I said.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I should've been a marriage counselor.
1,5,Bart,"Okay, Chidi, out with it."
1,5,Bart,What is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Be honest, Chidi."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Be, like, the exact right amount of honest so that we can both be happy."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I never had a soul mate on Earth.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I never even really had a girlfriend that I loved.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,"And when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited."
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,And it isn't exactly what I thought.
1,5,Nina,You've never had an intense relationship before.
1,5,Nina,This is all uncharted territory.
1,5,Bart,No wonder you're so tense.
1,5,Bart,"You know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage."
1,5,Bart,"Uh, not erotic massage."
1,5,Nina,Mmm.
1,5,Bart,"Although, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, you know what?"
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys have given us so much to think about.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think we should go to bed.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just the two of us, alone."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just us.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know it's not the right time, but I told you."
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, wake up, dear."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did it work?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did I fix the sinkhole?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Am I a heroine?
1,5,Michael,"No, you did something catastrophically stupid and we had to knock you unconscious."
1,5,Michael,Why in the world did you go outside?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Because I saw the rankings in the manual.
1,5,Michael,That manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.
1,5,Michael,It's got some very sensitive material.
1,5,Michael,"Plus some song lyrics I've been working on, and I'd rather not let people see those until they're finished."
1,5,Michael,"But, anyway, why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?"
1,5,Eunice,I was so sorry to hear of your parents' passing.
1,5,Eunice,Please bear with me as I share their last will and testament.
1,5,Eunice,"""To Kamilah, we have left 68,000,000, the home in Kensington, the yacht, and other assorted weekend boats."""
1,5,Eunice,"Well, what did they leave their second favorite child?"
1,5,Eunice,"There's still quite a lot of, uh, money and property that goes to you."
1,5,Eunice,"There is one issue, however."
1,5,Eunice,"They have, um, spelled your name incorrectly in the will."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,You've got to be kidding me.
1,5,Eunice,"It says, ""We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini."""
1,5,Eunice,Like the sauce.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,You know what?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't want the money.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,My sister can have it all.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My whole life, I have lived in your shadow, but now I'm going to step out of it."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am going to reach heights of success and sophistication that you can only dream of.
1,5,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Your cardigan's on inside out.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,I know!
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a new trend that I am starting.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just one example of how I'm going to step out of your shadow.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael."
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I just don't understand how I'm so low.
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My entire life, I have tried to be extraordinary, but it just never seemed to be enough."
1,5,Michael,Ah and you thought you could increase your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.
1,5,Michael,"Tahani, the point evaluations stop the moment you die."
1,5,Michael,"But also, out of literally billions, you were one of the most remarkable people on Earth."
1,5,Michael,"You have nothing left to prove, to anyone."
1,5,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,5,Janet,The sinkhole has begun to repair itself.
1,5,Michael,It has?
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,Could it be did I?
1,5,Michael,But how
1,5,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Tahani saves the --"""
1,5,Michael,"No, no, no."
1,5,Michael,Still not you.
1,5,Michael,You have nothing to do with it.
1,5,Michael,We've got to leave immediately.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Michael,It's now safe to go outside.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Morning, teach!"
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,Mornin'.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,What's this about?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, here's what I realized."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Every ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,I've never actually done this before.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,This is a theoretical fantasy.
1,5,Chidi Anagonye,How do you row a boat?
1,5,Michael,"I'll tell ya, it's good as new."
1,5,Michael,"Go ahead, if you want, just here."
1,5,Michael,See?
1,5,Michael,You can jump up and down on it.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, boss."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you fixed the sinkhole.
1,5,Michael,"Yup, good as new."
1,5,Michael,Crisis averted.
1,5,Michael,"Everybody have a wonderful day, because I fixed the sinkhole."
1,5,Michael,I didn't fix the sinkhole.
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry?
1,5,Michael,"I tried and I tried, but nothing worked."
1,5,Michael,"And then all of a sudden this morning, out of the blue, it just it just closed over."
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh how 'bout that?
1,5,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news."
1,5,Michael,"No, this is terrible news!"
1,5,Michael,"I have no idea what caused it, Eleanor."
1,5,Michael,And no idea what fixed it.
1,5,Michael,I want you to come to my office first thing in the morning.
1,5,Michael,You and I are gonna find this problem.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,What are you doing?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, I'm freaked out about my meeting with Michael, and if I spend one more second staring at Creepo the Clown, I'm gonna lose it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You named the clowns?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Psycho, Creepo, Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo, Freaky Feet and Nightmare George Washington."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,One of them has to go.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, sexy mailman."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Much better.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I did promise I would help."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I do here?
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, the answer is"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right here, in this easily understandable comic strip."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Nope, in this book about the theory of contractualism."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What We Owe to Each Other.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I saw this movie.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Laura Linney cries in a lake house because Jude Law left her for his ex-wife's ghost.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Quick summary of contractualism.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, ""If your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free""?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"So, if you said, ""We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions"", someone would veto that rule."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's called ""tyranny""."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,And it's generally frowned upon.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"If you make a promise to someone, you should do it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Just like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Despite your constant mockery."""
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever, you love it."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need to figure out a way to both help him and not help him at the same time.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,That's literally not possible.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, really?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I once posed as a hot prom date for my cousin, both helping him and later, according to his therapist, not helping him."
1,6,Michael,"Oh, hey, Eleanor."
1,6,Michael,Thanks for coming in.
1,6,Michael,Sorry about the mess.
1,6,Michael,"Oh, I forgot, you don't see in nine dimensions."
1,6,Michael,There's just a lot of there's a lot of tension in the air right now.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are you okay, buddy?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You seem kind of stressed.
1,6,Michael,"No, no, no, I'm fine."
1,6,Michael,"Top of my game, actually."
1,6,Michael,"Um, here, let me just have a seat."
1,6,Michael,There you go.
1,6,Michael,"So, to prepare to meet all of you, I studied the human concept of friends."
1,6,Michael,I even watched all ten seasons of the show Friends.
1,6,Michael,"Boy, those Friends really were friends, weren't they?"
1,6,Michael,"Although, and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being how did they afford that apartment?"
1,6,Michael,A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we were all confused about that too."
1,6,Michael,"Anyway, it's been a tough couple of days."
1,6,Michael,"Right now, I could really use a friend by my side."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you know me, the person who has audibly promised to help you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you need me to house-sit the whole week?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vacay.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"As I told you before, my mom is very sick."
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,I'm gonna help her move into assisted living.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm here for you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in."
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"Walk and feed him twice a day, give him his kidney medicine."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yup, got it."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Feed his kidneys.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,Eleanor
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah?
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,I need to know that I can count on you.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I won't let you down.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promise.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, my love."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,How are you?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,I am decidedly so.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's very profound.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Um, soulmate."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,An idea.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Our neighborhood now features a spa, and it offers couples packages."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I thought maybe we could get facials, and do yoga, and talk in long, discursive sentences."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,What do you say?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Signs point to yes.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Marvelous!
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,We'll go today.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, you got to come with us to the spa."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No way.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"No, that's really weird."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"No, I can't."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,She freaks me out.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"She's so pretty, like Nala from The Lion King."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"And she talks so smart, like Nala from The Lion King."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,You gotta help me.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Although, maybe it's better not to know."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You ready, Jianyu?"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I cannot wait to just relax, and talk, and chat and just, you know get to know each other."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe I'll come too.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, Chidi it's just that this is, um this is really more of a couples thing."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Right?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Made in Taiwan.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, you were."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You were made in Taiwan.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,So couples date!
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Let's go!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never really looked around your office the first day.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is all this junk?
1,6,Michael,"Well, technically, architects aren't allowed to own any human objects, but oh, I just love them so much."
1,6,Michael,"And over here, look at this."
1,6,Michael,Aren't paper clips the most amazing things in the world?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
1,6,Michael,"Anyway, my current theory is that some object in the neighborhood is a design flaw which is causing everything to go haywire."
1,6,Michael,So we need to find that object.
1,6,Michael,We're gonna start with the rocks.
1,6,Michael,"Now, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood."
1,6,Michael,These 78 are the most suspicious.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, maybe to an architect they might look suspicious, but to me, they just look like rocks, so I'm not sure how I can help."
1,6,Michael,Do any of them look defective?
1,6,Michael,Sinister?
1,6,Michael,"You know, like they're taunting you?"
1,6,Michael,Always one step ahead?
1,6,Michael,"You devious little monsters, you."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, let's take a deep breath here, buddy."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need to chill a little.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cause you have a very psycho, ""burnout guy muttering to himself at a library computer"" type vibe."
1,6,Michael,It's my responsibility to solve the problem.
1,6,Michael,What else can I do except keep working?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You could stop working.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break."
1,6,Michael,And not working will help me work?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Recharge the old batteries.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promise this is gonna help both of us.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,6,Michael,Okay.
1,6,Michael,Let's keep our eyes peeled for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, crazy, come on."
1,6,Michael,Yeah.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Janet."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu and I are here for the couples package, please."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"And, also, I will be joining them."
1,6,Janet,"Great, and who is the other half of your couple?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no, no, it's just me."
1,6,Janet,Couples are pairs of people.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,And then also I am here.
1,6,Janet,"Great, and who will be joining you?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,No one.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, it's really quite simple, Janet."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"They are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,It's a three-person couple.
1,6,Janet,Does not compute.
1,6,Janet,Does not compute.
1,6,Janet,I'm just kidding.
1,6,Janet,"I mean, it doesn't compute, but I'm not gonna explode or anything."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Right.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I'll see you inside, darling."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, you have to step up."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Find a way to connect with her without, you know, being you."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,What does that even mean?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Do I talk or not talk?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw all her jewelry in the toilet?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,That's the opposite of being nice?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,So no toilet?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is it with you and frozen yogurt?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have you not heard of ice cream?
1,6,Michael,"Oh, sure, but I've come to really like frozen yogurt."
1,6,Michael,There's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ha!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is very human.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why do you need a human to be your assistant?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, aren't there more of whatever you are?"
1,6,Michael,"Well, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Weird combo to pick, but okay."
1,6,Michael,I'm gonna tell you a secret.
1,6,Michael,"Usually, architects don't live in their neighborhoods."
1,6,Michael,"Usually, the people show up, we play the movie, Janet is there to answer questions, and you're on your own."
1,6,Michael,But I had this theory.
1,6,Michael,"I thought transition would be easier if the architect were on-site for at least the first 1,000 years or so."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's why you've been so freaked out, 'cause your butt is on the line."
1,6,Michael,My boss thought I was nuts.
1,6,Michael,"And if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble."
1,6,Michael,"But more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy."
1,6,Michael,And you just don't break a promise.
1,6,Michael,"Unlike Ross, when he promised Emily not to talk to Rachel."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, you are really into that show."
1,6,Michael,You know something?
1,6,Michael,I feel better already.
1,6,Michael,Should we get back to work?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,The whole point is to stop thinking about work and start having fun.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, what should we do first?"
1,6,Michael,This is so interesting!
1,6,Michael,"I mean, there's no point to it."
1,6,Michael,The images on the screen relate to nothing.
1,6,Michael,"Some time passed, and then it was over."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's karaoke!
1,6,Michael,"Oh, let's do it again."
1,6,Janet,"Okay, my hands are heated to the ideal 105 degrees."
1,6,Janet,Who would like to go first?
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, well, what if I go first, and then perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and share some intimate aspects of his life?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Or what if while Janet massages Tahani, I massage Jianyu?"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,I adore the impressionists.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who's your favorite artist?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, Pitbull changed the game --"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area."
1,6,Michael,"Oh, man!"
1,6,Michael,I didn't even want that thing.
1,6,Michael,Why am I trying to win it?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because the machine says it's a prize.
1,6,Michael,How many tickets do I get?
1,6,Michael,Six?
1,6,Michael,Is that all?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, watch this."
1,6,Michael,Is that allowed?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not really.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,But it is a time-honored tradition.
1,6,Michael,Say no more.
1,6,Michael,I got it.
1,6,Michael,I got it.
1,6,Michael,You know something?
1,6,Michael,"As much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful."
1,6,Michael,Sometimes all you guys think about is how you can have the most fun.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Exactly!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was practically my mantra.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's up, dong bait?"
1,6,Brittany,Ha-ha.
1,6,Brittany,Drop everything you're doing.
1,6,Brittany,Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
1,6,Brittany,I got tickets.
1,6,Brittany,We are road-tripping.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I can't!"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog."
1,6,Brittany,"I'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts topless on a yacht like a boss?"
1,6,Brittany,Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a very good point.
1,6,Brittany,This is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.
1,6,Brittany,The booze is free there.
1,6,Brittany,Do I really need to keep going?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, this is dinner tonight, breakfast tomorrow I have an idea."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is in case of emergency.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do not eat this unless it's an emergency.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm ready to be a mom.
1,6,Janet,I'm having trouble getting this mask to stick.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, it's 'cause my pores are just so small."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,There's no way anything could ever adhere to my skin.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's a curse, really."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, what are your pores like?"
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, can you show me to the sauna, please?"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Dude, she's trying so hard, and you're giving her nothing!"
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Just pick a fact that you know about her and just muddle through.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,She said she likes impressionist paintings.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Impressionist paintings?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, say no more."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no, I definitely feel like I need to say more."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,Jianyu
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,So would you say I helped you today?
1,6,Michael,"Oh, so much."
1,6,Michael,"I had fun, I didn't think about my problems, and I won this ugly yellow toddler, which is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen."
1,6,Michael,Thank you so much.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, I'll see you tomorrow, friend."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,You sure this is where you want to be right now?
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,At the Tea for Two couples cafe?
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"There's no use avoiding it, Chidi."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm alone.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jianyu and I have nothing in common.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just want a soulmate.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Someone I can share my passions with, someone who I can talk to about the ethereal colors of a Degas."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,I love Degas.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"I took painting lessons as a kid, and Degas was always my inspiration."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,And do you like France as much as I do?
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, they enslaved my country for 300 years."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"So, no."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,But they have great museums.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
1,6,Waitress,"Welcome to my cafe, you two."
1,6,Waitress,We have a special on soulmate muffins.
1,6,Waitress,Two for the price of zero.
1,6,Waitress,Everything is free.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, we're not soulmates."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,We're just soul friends.
1,6,Waitress,Oh.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have all new fun stuff for us to do today.
1,6,Michael,"Eleanor, I have huge news."
1,6,Michael,Not working actually worked.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,It did what now?
1,6,Michael,"After our day off, with a completely clear head, I realized part of what makes humans so fun is that they're unpredictable."
1,6,Michael,The chaos we've been experiencing is exactly what would happen if a resident behaved unpredictably.
1,6,Michael,"The problem in our neighborhood, it's not a rock or an object."
1,6,Michael,It's one of the people.
1,6,Michael,Oh!
1,6,Michael,We need to celebrate.
1,6,Michael,"I know, okay"
1,6,Michael,Paper clip shower!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So do you think we're looking for a man, or do you think we're looking for two men?"
1,6,Michael,Not sure.
1,6,Michael,We don't know anything about this person.
1,6,Michael,"I mean, does he or she even know that they caused all these problems?"
1,6,Michael,"No, that can't be."
1,6,Michael,"I mean, what kind of monster would wreak havoc and then say nothing?"
1,6,Michael,So this is the main place where the garbage fell from the sky.
1,6,Michael,Janet.
1,6,Janet,Hi there.
1,6,Michael,I need a list of everyone that was here on garbage duty during orientation.
1,6,Michael,"Oh Eleanor, our criminal is on this very short list."
1,6,Janet,People were flying that day too.
1,6,Janet,I'll add everybody who flew overhead.
1,6,Michael,"Eleanor, our criminal is on this much longer list."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, hey, homey."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Thanks for your advice.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,I'm about to give Tahani the best gift ever.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,Check it.
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"She likes impressionist paintings, right?"
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"I got her a painting of the best impressionist of all time, Frank Caliendo."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,He can do it all.
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Fat Al Pacino, fat Jerry Seinfeld, regular John Madden."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"""Say hello to my little friend."
1,6,Jason Mendoza,"Forget about it."""
1,6,Michael,This is where the sinkhole opened up.
1,6,Michael,And the guest list that night was limited.
1,6,Janet,There were a total of 30 people here that night.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Only 30, huh?"
1,6,Michael,Yeah!
1,6,Michael,How do you pump your fist again?
1,6,Michael,Is this it?
1,6,Janet,"But, 66 others passed through to take a look before it opened, and everyone else in the neighborhood was in a close radius."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy, that doesn't narrow it down at all."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Feels like the end of the road.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"End of the Road, Boyz II Men, karaoke."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't think about it too much.
1,6,Michael,Janet.
1,6,Michael,"My hoodie, please."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's happening?
1,6,Michael,I give up.
1,6,Michael,I can't help the people I promised that I would help.
1,6,Michael,"I feel like Friends in Season 8, out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel together, even though it made no sense."
1,6,Michael,I hope the sinkhole opens up again and swallows me whole.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Paula!
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, girl."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,How's the dog?
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"Still fat, Eleanor."
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,Still fat.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,The vet says his stomach expanded to the size of a basketball and that it will never shrink.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, well, that's not my fault."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,How was I supposed to know he would literally eat all of the food?
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,It shouldn't have been an issue.
1,6,Paula Ouncerock,"You were supposed to be there, but you broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very bulbous dog."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you know what?"
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're rude.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause you didn't even ask me how the Rihanna concert was.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,She was very late.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,And a little drunk.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I promised to help you, and I will, however I can."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you want to look at a million rocks like a psychopath, I'll be there."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you want to just lay here and cry in your hoodie, I'm cool with that."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, I don't know how I can help you, 'cause I'm just a person and you're, like, this super-magical Orville Redenbacher-type guy who invented this entire universe, but I'll do my best."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm right here.
1,6,Michael,"Oh, my gosh."
1,6,Michael,Of course.
1,6,Michael,How did I not see it?
1,6,Michael,Janet I found the answer to the problem.
1,6,Michael,Call a neighborhood meeting.
1,6,Janet,Should it be festive and casual or moribund and devastating?
1,6,Michael,"Moribund and devastating, please."
1,6,Janet,Great!
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Jianyu, Chidi."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's this?
1,6,Jason Mendoza,I made you a art.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's three of me.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's ballerinas, painted in the style of the impressionists."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You don't say things, but you do things."
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,And you feel things.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Only my true soulmate could ever give me such a perfect gift.
1,6,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you!
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,What's going on?
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I did what you said."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I honored my agreement to help Michael find the problem, and he found the problem."
1,6,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,"After I'm gone, take down the rest of those clown paintings."
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,But leave up the sexy mailman.
1,6,Eleanor Shellstrop,To remember me by.
1,6,Michael,Thank you all for your patience with the problems in our neighborhood.
1,6,Michael,I have finally discovered the cause.
1,6,Michael,There was one common link among every incident.
1,6,Michael,"And when I figured it out, it was a shock."
1,6,Michael,But there's no escaping it.
1,6,Michael,The problem is me.
1,6,Michael,"And now, I have to leave you forever."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, you can't be the problem."
1,7,Michael,"Oh, but I am."
1,7,Michael,"You see, architects aren't supposed to live in the neighborhoods they design, but I love humans, so I wanted to try."
1,7,Michael,I see now that was a mistake.
1,7,Michael,My meddling is the one true constant in all of our disasters.
1,7,Michael,"I tried to force Jianyu into opening up, which caused a sinkhole to open up."
1,7,Michael,"I kicked a puppy into the sun, and garbage rained down."
1,7,Michael,"I grossly underestimated the number of shrimp needed for the opening-night party, and what flew through the sky the next day, taunting me for my failures?"
1,7,Michael,"I'm sorry, everyone."
1,7,Michael,I'm truly sorry.
1,7,Michael,Janet?
1,7,Michael,Please call a train to escort me into retirement.
1,7,Michael,"You see, the only way in and out of a neighborhood is by train, and Janet is the only one who can operate them."
1,7,Michael,"Oh, my dear Janet."
1,7,Michael,Will you be okay after I leave?
1,7,Janet,Yes.
1,7,Janet,This will not affect me in any way.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Jeez, show some compassion."
1,7,Janet,"Well, I can't feel sad, but here's my best approximation of human crying."
1,7,Michael,"Oh, Janet, that was beautiful."
1,7,Janet,Yeah.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,What did you say to him?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Did you make him do this somehow?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nope, this was entirely his idea."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, this is good news."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael's gonna get a chill retirement, which, frankly, he desperately needs, and I can finally relax."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's forking perfect.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"No, it's terrible."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Michael's wrong.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,He's not the problem.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, Michael did bring me here, which was the mistake that led to all the other problems."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, in that sense, he is the real problem."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ha!
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do you like them ethics?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi!"
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,It doesn't change the fact that we weren't truthful.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"There's an old Chinese proverb ""Lies are like tigers."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"They are bad."""
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's it?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,It's more poetic in Mandarin.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, Michael is retiring."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere, smoking moonbeam cigars."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, Tahani is throwing him a good-bye party."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go help out.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, that will more than make up for the pain and misery and lying."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, now you're getting it."
1,7,Henry,"Hey, Chidi, just read your article on logical positivism so dry."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, thanks, Henry."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Whoa!
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,New boots.
1,7,Henry,"Oh, yeah, just got 'em."
1,7,Henry,"Saw them in the store, and I was just like, ""Whoa!"""
1,7,Henry,Tell the truth do you like 'em?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh oh, yeah."
1,7,Henry,Not too red?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,No.
1,7,Henry,Crystals aren't too much?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Crystals are not too much.
1,7,Henry,"Oh, well, that makes me feel much better 'cause I was really going back and forth over whether they were worth the money."
1,7,Henry,They were super expensive.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, well, they're, uh, amazing."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Those are the coolest boots I've ever seen in my life.
1,7,Henry,"Thanks so much, buddy."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Bye.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,My God what have I done?
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Tonight needs to be the perfect blend of celebratory, reverential, bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is #TahaniTime.
1,7,Michael,What is all this?
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no, Michael, you're not supposed to see it till it's all set up."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But, well welcome to your retirement party."
1,7,Michael,Hm.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, over there, I've even set up a buffet of themed desserts, like retire-mint chocolate cake"
1,7,Michael,Ah.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Or a, flan-voyage."
1,7,Michael,"Oh, boy."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, and here we have a pinata shaped like you, which is always fun."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"By the way, uh, what's your favorite color for the tablecloths?"
1,7,Michael,"Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes."
1,7,Michael,It's called pleurigloss.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Could you describe it?
1,7,Michael,It's the color of when a soldier comes home from war and sees his dog for the first time.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hmm.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,How about blue?
1,7,Michael,"Tahani, I'm so sorry."
1,7,Michael,We need to cancel this party immediately.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,But why?
1,7,Michael,"For a being like me, retirement is not something fun."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"What is ""retirement"" for you exactly?"
1,7,Michael,"Well, I wasn't gonna share this so as not to upset you, but it's a an extreme form of punishment."
1,7,Michael,"We call it, ""The Eternal Shriek""."
1,7,Michael,"My soul will be disintegrated, and each molecule will be placed on the surface of a different burning sun."
1,7,Michael,And then my essence will be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle and poured over hot diamonds.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, but the diamonds sound lovely."
1,7,Michael,They're not
1,7,Michael,"And then what's left of my body will be endlessly beaten with a titanium rod, like a"
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like a pinata.
1,7,Michael,"Yes, except you have the string around my waist, but instead it will definitely be around my genitals."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry."
1,7,Michael,Mm.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was just trying to honor you.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Please, allow me to re-conceive the event."
1,7,Michael,Of course.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"All right, everyone, we're starting over."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The key word for tonight is just, ""somber""."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to get rid of all of the party poppers immediately."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, not by using them."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, Jianyu."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Done.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's gonna be tortured?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dang it.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was almost handed a perfect solution to all my problems without having to work for it at all, and now it's gone."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why do bad things always happen to mediocre people who are lying about their identities?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, you have two options."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"You can confess and save Michael, or you can continue to lie and condemn him to an eternity of unimaginable pain."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or option C continue to lie about myself and find a way to save Michael.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That would be a classic ""two birds with one stone"" scenario."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, I'd get her house."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Three birds.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"No, there's no way to stop this except confessing."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Any moment now, Michael is going to get on that train, and we will never see him again, just like Professor Lindeman after I asked him to reread my 3,600-page manuscript."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"He said he was going out for cigarettes, but then he just left his tenured position at the Sorbonne."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great story.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
1,7,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,So the only way out of the neighborhood is a train?
1,7,Janet,That's correct.
1,7,Janet,"I am the only one who can call the train, and it needs me to operate."
1,7,Janet,Choo-choo!
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One more question, and, um, this is a little weird, but can we, uh, shut you down?"
1,7,Janet,"Yes, great question."
1,7,Janet,There is a kill switch in a remote sector of the neighborhood in the event that I malfunction and attempt to harm the residents.
1,7,Janet,"If you press it, I will be destroyed."
1,7,Janet,Anything else?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, that's good, thanks."
1,7,Janet,Okay.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Whoa.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,You want to kill Janet?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael can't retire if he can't leave.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,He can't leave if there's no Janet to run the train.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a perfect solution.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, high five, please?"
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, babe."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,You cannot kill Janet.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Killing is one of the most famous moral no-nos.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet is a non-human object who was sent here to help us, and the way she can help us is if we kill her."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're doing one small murder-y thing for a bigger, better reason."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,The ends justify the means.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Do you know who said that?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Was it someone nice and great, like Oprah?"
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,It was Machiavelli a very non-Oprah-like figure.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,And what happens after we kill her?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"We'll have to lie to everyone about what we did, and lying is always wrong."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I don't like his boots.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I hate his boots.
1,7,Allesandra,"Yes, I know."
1,7,Allesandra,You've talked about it for the last two days.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I lied to him.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,You wrote your thesis on Kant.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,He believed that lying is always morally wrong no exceptions.
1,7,Allesandra,"Yes, well, Kant was a lonely, obsessive hermit with zero friends."
1,7,Allesandra,"Sometimes we do things just to be polite, but if you really feel that strongly about it, tell him the truth."
1,7,Allesandra,"Also, I don't care, 'cause it's the middle of the night."
1,7,Allesandra,This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,They do?
1,7,Henry,"Hey, Chidi."
1,7,Henry,You sit in on my class today?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I did, yeah."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Great lecture, by the way so bleak."
1,7,Henry,"Thanks, bud."
1,7,Henry,It's actually perfect that you are here.
1,7,Henry,I got something for you.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
1,7,Henry,"You loved mine so much, I decided to get you your own pair."
1,7,Henry,We can be boot brothers.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I can't accept these.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,They're too expensive.
1,7,Henry,Sure you can.
1,7,Henry,"Try 'em on, mate."
1,7,Henry,The fact that you liked mine so much really made me feel like I made the right choice to buy them.
1,7,Henry,"After all, why should I have all the fun and boots?"
1,7,Henry,Eh?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I don't I don't know.
1,7,Henry,Those look great.
1,7,Henry,Take 'em for a spin.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
1,7,Henry,You're flying.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm!
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Thanks.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Speeches!
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Time for speeches, everyone."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael
1,7,Michael,Huh.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As someone who didn't exactly have the steadiest parental guidance, I just want to thank you."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,You were always there for us.
1,7,Michael,I shouldn't have been.
1,7,Michael,I was the problem.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, but it was also great when you weren't there."
1,7,Michael,Don't worry.
1,7,Michael,Soon I won't be forever.
1,7,Glenn,Because of The Eternal Shriek!
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, thank you, Glenn."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, what I'm trying to say is this."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, you always kept us warm and safe like a bright, glowing sun."
1,7,Michael,Like the one I kicked the dog into or the one I'm going to be burned on the surface of for eternity?
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, no more speeches."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Speeches are over.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael's going to talk now.
1,7,Michael,I'm sorry I was so grumpy.
1,7,Michael,It's just I'm sad that I have to leave before doing all the human things that I wanted to do.
1,7,Michael,I wanted to get my hair wet.
1,7,Michael,You know I wanted to pull a hamstring.
1,7,Michael,"To learn the difference between ""toward"" and ""towards""."
1,7,Michael,"I wanted to do that thing where you walk down the hallway, and someone else is walking the other way, and then you both lean to one side and then the other, and then you both chuckle over your shared foible."
1,7,Michael,"I wanted to get a rewards card, any rewards card."
1,7,Michael,"I wanted to talk briefly to someone and then say, ""Take it sleazy."""
1,7,Michael,I wanted to eat a saltine.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,I actually have some saltines.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Here, try this."
1,7,Michael,Pretty dry and too salty.
1,7,Michael,"Well, going out on a real low note here."
1,7,Michael,"Okay, bye, everyone."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, take it sleazy."
1,7,Michael,You got to say it?
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, but then you say it back."
1,7,Michael,"No, it's not organic."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, Janet, how many Janets have there been?"
1,7,Janet,There have been 25 generations of Janet.
1,7,Janet,Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom and social abilities.
1,7,Janet,Fun fact the first Janet had a click wheel.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,So it's like aging for a human?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,You're you're growing up?
1,7,Janet,"That's how I like to think of it, Chidi."
1,7,Janet,"I can't eat, so every time there's a new version of Janet, I like to take a piece of birthday cake and smash it around where my mouth is."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, Janet has has learned and grown."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,She's essentially living a life.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,We can't kill her.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not with that attitude, we can't."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, man, I'm dead, you're dead, we all died, and now we're killing her."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pay it forward.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"No, that's not what that means at all."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor?
1,7,Janet,Here we are.
1,7,Janet,"Just press that button, and it's good-bye, Janet."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
1,7,Janet,"Chidi, I can see that you're worried, and I just want to assure you, I am not human, and I cannot feel pain."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Ah.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,That helps.
1,7,Janet,"However, I should warn you I am programmed with a fail-safe measure."
1,7,Janet,"As you begin to approach the kill switch, I will begin to beg for my life."
1,7,Janet,"It's just there in case of an accidental shut down, but it will seem very real."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So who's doing this, me or you?"
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I think I have to."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, being a bystander seems worse, somehow."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, here we go."
1,7,Janet,"Chidi, no, no, no!"
1,7,Janet,"Chidi, please!"
1,7,Janet,"Please, please, please don't hurt me."
1,7,Janet,I don't want to die!
1,7,Janet,"Please, please"
1,7,Janet,"Again, I am not human."
1,7,Janet,I can't die.
1,7,Janet,I am simply an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge built to make your life easier.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Your pleading seems so real.
1,7,Janet,"Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You want a robot killed right, you have to do it yourself."
1,7,Janet,Eleanor?
1,7,Janet,"Eleanor, no, no, no."
1,7,Janet,"Please, wait, wait, wait, wait."
1,7,Janet,"Eleanor, I have kids."
1,7,Janet,"I have three beautiful children Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip."
1,7,Janet,Look at Tyler.
1,7,Janet,"Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ."
1,7,Janet,Look at him.
1,7,Janet,"No, Eleanor, look at them."
1,7,Janet,Look at them!
1,7,Janet,Look at them!
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's so realistic.
1,7,Janet,"Eleanor, again, I'm not human."
1,7,Janet,This is a stock photo of the crowd at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's right, it's not real."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's just do this.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
1,7,Janet,"Please, I have so much to live for."
1,7,Janet,"No, no, no."
1,7,Janet,Please.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,We're not even near the
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"That party was lame, so I bailed."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Then I saw you, so I followed you here."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, look, a button."
1,7,Janet,"No, no, no!"
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man, I wanted to push that button."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Not cool, dude."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,Woah.
1,7,Jason Mendoza,What happened to Janet?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,She's dead.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I killed her.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not killed.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Remember, Janet was not a living being, so she can't be killed."
1,7,Janet,Attention I have been murdered.
1,7,Janet,Attention I have been murdered.
1,7,Janet,Attention I have been murdered.
1,7,Janet,Attention I have been murdered.
1,7,Janet,Attention
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"What do we do, Eleanor?"
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do we do?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, you just murdered Janet."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to flee your crime scene.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Run!
1,7,Janet,I have been murdered.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, Janet!"
1,7,Janet,I have been murdered.
1,7,Janet,Attention I have
1,7,Janet,Attention I have been murdered.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, dude, crash course in getting away with bad stuff."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have to act calm and cool like you don't have a care in the world.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, it's Weekend at Bernie's, 'cause you're a dead guy in sunglasses."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We have fun, don't we, Chidi?"
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I've never been more stressed out in my entire life.
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Um, I know what you need."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, can you get Chidi some weed?"
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, that's right."
1,7,Jason Mendoza,You killed Janet.
1,7,Michael,"Well, Janet's been murdered."
1,7,Michael,That's a nice capper to this wonderful day.
1,7,Michael,"I don't really know what happens now because Janet has never been murdered before only today, here on my watch, while I was distracted with a party that Tahani was throwing for me, which I didn't want."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, you mustn't blame yourself."
1,7,Michael,I'm not.
1,7,Michael,I'm blaming you.
1,7,Michael,"Anyway, what is there to say about Janet that hasn't already been said by the giant Janet alarm in the sky?"
1,7,Michael,"""I've been murdered!"""
1,7,Michael,I think that says it all.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Michael,"Janet, you're alive!"
1,7,Janet,"Hello, Architect, please enter your four-digit pin."
1,7,Michael,"Uh, what is it?"
1,7,Michael,"Uh, what is it?"
1,7,Michael,What is it?
1,7,Michael,"Oh, right, right, right!"
1,7,Michael,"It's my, uh, birth year."
1,7,Michael,Uh
1,7,Michael,I got to change that.
1,7,Michael,That's too easy to guess.
1,7,Michael,Janet who murdered you?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Michael,"Yes, hello."
1,7,Michael,"Oh, yeah."
1,7,Michael,"Uh, her memory must have been wiped clean so now she's gonna have to re-upload all the knowledge in the universe, which will only take a few days."
1,7,Michael,Okay
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Michael,Hello.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Michael,"Everyone, um, until I get to the bottom of this, my retirement is officially postponed."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Woo!
1,7,Michael,"Oh, oh."
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,You got to admit I kind of nailed it.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,All we have to do now is keep the secret forever.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"J-Dog, you cool?"
1,7,Jason Mendoza,"No, by the time I got to the pinata, all the candy was gone."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not gonna tell anyone.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cheedster?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's, uh, happening, buddy?"
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You have a crazy look in your eye, and you're retreating into your shirt."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're kind of turtling.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Henry, are you all right?"
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,What happened?
1,7,Henry,I have an aneurysm.
1,7,Henry,Requires emergency surgery.
1,7,Henry,Doctors' give me a 50/50 chance.
1,7,Henry,"So, if there's anything you need to say to me, you should do it now."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well actually, um they let you wear your boots in here?"
1,7,Henry,They're the only things that bring me comfort.
1,7,Henry,What did you want to say to me?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, uh just that I'm here and I love you, man."
1,7,Henry,"I love you, too, boot brother."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Oh okay.
1,7,Henry,Chidi!
1,7,Henry,You didn't have to stay here all night.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,So surgery went well?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,All clear?
1,7,Henry,"Right as rain, buddy."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"That is so, so, so great."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I hate your boots.
1,7,Henry,What?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"I told you that I loved your boots three years ago, and I was lying, and that lie has haunted me ever since, and people tried to tell me it was fine just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties but I disagreed, and then yesterday I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead, and I can finally be honest and say that those boots are terrible and hideous and I hate them."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Whoo!
1,7,Henry,This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I know."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,And I get it.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I don't care that she came back or that we did it for a good reason.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I can't live with this lie.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I'm going to confess to the murder of Janet.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, why?"
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet is fine.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,We didn't harm her at all.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,We didn't?
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, Janet?"
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Jason Mendoza,Hello.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet?"
1,7,Janet,A-B Janet.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,She knows her A-B-Janets.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"She literally knew everything in the universe, and now she's a baby."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"And even if she were okay, it would be too painful for me to live with these lies."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you talking about?
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,It is so easy to live with a lie.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,I once pretended to have a terminal illness to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Victimless crime.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,Fine.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,I won't say anything because I promised to help you.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"And the moral implications of everything that we've done are so complicated that I may never untangle them, but I hate lying."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"I always have, and this is going to eat me up inside forever."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will."
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Jason Mendoza,Hi.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Jason Mendoza,Hi.
1,7,Janet,Hello.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jianyu!
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying, ""Hello"" over and over again, but she did point at you."
1,7,Michael,I owe you an apology.
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, you don't."
1,7,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No but, uh, please continue."
1,7,Michael,You were only trying to help.
1,7,Michael,"You're a wonderful person, and if I ever do have a retirement party, I hope you plan it."
1,7,Michael,"Thank you for gathering, everyone."
1,7,Michael,I want to keep you all updated.
1,7,Michael,Here's what we know.
1,7,Michael,Someone slaughtered Janet.
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy."
1,7,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, easy."
1,7,Michael,I assume that this horrifying act is somehow related to the other issues we've had here.
1,7,Michael,It also means that the problems in this neighborhood are not 100% my fault.
1,7,Michael,There is something else at work here.
1,7,Michael,"If anyone has any information about any of this I beg you, tell me."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I love you, man."
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael the problem in the neighborhood is me.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was brought to The Good Place by mistake.
1,7,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not supposed to be here.
1,8,Michael,"Eleanor, come on in."
1,8,Michael,"Well, not often you get to confront your greatest failure face-to-face."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good to see you, too, bud."
1,8,Michael,I am just dumbfounded as to how this happened.
1,8,Michael,Our system has never made a mistake before it's just not possible.
1,8,Michael,"And yet, here we are."
1,8,Michael,First things first who are you?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and some of the info you had was right."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, ""flattened by boner pill truck after dropping margarita mix in grocery store parking lot"", that's a very me way to die."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,But all the other info was wrong.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In my defense, when I first arrived, and you said, ""You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead, and you're in The Good Place."""
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I had no reason to think that was a mistake.
1,8,Michael,"Location and date of birth, please."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Phoenix, Arizona, October 14th, 1986."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,So sorry.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I used to tell people when I lied about my age.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was born in 1982.
1,8,Michael,"You lied so much, you forgot your own birthday."
1,8,Michael,"Not a great start, but it should be enough for Janet to locate your file."
1,8,Michael,Janet?
1,8,Michael,Janet
1,8,Janet,What's that?
1,8,Janet,What's that?
1,8,Janet,What's this?
1,8,Michael,"Her memory's still being rebooted because, oh, you know, someone murdered her."
1,8,Michael,"Janet, could you please locate the file for an Eleanor Shellstrop, born in 1982?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,8,Michael,"Phoenix, Arizona, USA."
1,8,Janet,Sure.
1,8,Janet,Anything else?
1,8,Michael,"No, Janet, this is actually a cactus."
1,8,Michael,This might take a while.
1,8,Janet,Whee!
1,8,Michael,"Since Janet can't retrieve your file, I need to find another way to determine what kind of person you were."
1,8,Michael,This is a quick litmus test.
1,8,Michael,Handful of questions designed to tell whether you were fundamentally good or bad.
1,8,Michael,Question number one.
1,8,Michael,"Did you ever commit a serious crime, such as murder, sexual harassment, arson, or otherwise?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,8,Michael,"Did you ever have a vanity license plate, like ""Mama's BMW"" ""Lexus for Liz"" or ""Boob guy""?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,8,Michael,Did you ever reheat fish in an office microwave?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ew, no."
1,8,Michael,Have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band The Red Hot Chili Peppers?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,8,Michael,Did you ever take off your shoes and socks on a commercial airline?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,And socks?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ew, who would do that?"
1,8,Michael,"People who go to The Bad Place, Eleanor, that's the point."
1,8,Michael,"And unless I can figure out a compelling reason to keep you here, you will spend eternity with murderers, and arsonists, and people who take off their shoes and socks on commercial airlines."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can I have a glass of water, please?"
1,8,Janet,Here you go.
1,8,Janet,"Oh, gosh."
1,8,Janet,"You said, ""Water""?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,8,Janet,I'm so sorry.
1,8,Janet,There you go.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ah
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,I really do have sympathy for your situation.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I mean, you thought your soul mate was a good person, and then you learned that she's just an immoral grifter."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Tahani, please."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,Am I wrong?
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,She lied to everyone.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,She caused a giant sinkhole into which poor Glenn fell.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,She caused a trash storm.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"She well, she pretended to be my friend when I really needed one."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, lest we forget, she murdered Janet."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As far as I'm concerned, the sooner she's gone, the better off we'll all be."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"I understand that Eleanor violated our trust, but please, when you're talking to Michael, try to think about what she's had to go through."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,All right.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I will, for you."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we've been through a lot as well.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I haven't been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other friend, Kanye, who was defending my best friend, Beyonce."
1,8,Michael,"And finally, a multi-part question."
1,8,Michael,"Did you ever appear on the American television program The Bachelor or its companion shows, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise, or post on any social media site that you were emotionally invested in any of the relationships the contestants were pursuing?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,8,Michael,Okay.
1,8,Michael,"You did very well on the questionnaire, Eleanor."
1,8,Michael,"So far, so good."
1,8,Janet,"Michael, good news."
1,8,Janet,I was able to obtain Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
1,8,Michael,Is it actually a cactus?
1,8,Janet,I don't understand.
1,8,Michael,I want to see the file for Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,8,Michael,"Is that what you have, or do you have a cactus?"
1,8,Janet,I have the file.
1,8,Michael,You're sure?
1,8,Michael,You have the file and not a cactus?
1,8,Janet,That is correct.
1,8,Janet,I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
1,8,Janet,I do not have a cactus.
1,8,Michael,Excellent!
1,8,Michael,"Please, give me the file."
1,8,Janet,Here you go.
1,8,Michael,"Thank you, Janet."
1,8,Janet,You're welcome.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I say we call it a day."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I nailed the questionnaire, and you're swimming in cacti."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can't we just chalk this up to a hilarious mistake and move on?
1,8,Michael,"No, we can't, Eleanor."
1,8,Michael,There's no such thing as a mistake in this realm.
1,8,Michael,"And yet, you are, somehow, a mistake."
1,8,Michael,"I mean, you're a giant chunk of spinach in the teeth of the universe."
1,8,Michael,I need to understand every facet of this disaster.
1,8,Michael,Tell me a lie about yourself.
1,8,Michael,Any lie.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love the opera.
1,8,Michael,And now a truth.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love Women's MMA.
1,8,Michael,We don't like to use this.
1,8,Michael,"We've never really had a call for it before you, but in the interest of time."
1,8,Michael,"Eleanor, did you murder Janet?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I did not."
1,8,Michael,Do you know who did?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
1,8,Michael,Will you tell me who it was?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,8,Michael,"I assume it was one of your friends, and I admire you for protecting him or her."
1,8,Michael,"But, Eleanor, in The Good Place, there's no room for bad people or bad actions."
1,8,Michael,"So anyone involved in the murder of Janet will be reviewed and judged, and there will be consequences."
1,8,Michael,"Tahani, come on in."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,Chidi.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,Impostor who soiled our paradise with her moral turpitude.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sup?
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Thank you for confessing, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't --"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm amazing.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bad news.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael knows I didn't kill Janet, which means it's only a matter of time before he finds out that you did and that you did it because you were trying to stop Bonehead Jones over here."
1,8,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, homies!"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Then he'll figure out that Jianyu's also a phony, and, here's the real dong-buster, Michael said anybody who did anything bad might have to go"
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,Oh
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Which means Jianyu's gone, you might be gone, and all three of us are royally forking forked!"
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,This is terrible.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,What am I supposed to do if he asks me?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Kant would say that lying in any scenario is wrong, so if Michael asks you if you killed Janet, you should say yes."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"On the other hand, snitches do get stitches."
1,8,Jason Mendoza,That is true.
1,8,Jason Mendoza,I read that once on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,You just casually cited Immanuel Kant.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I know we're in a miserable bind here, but this might be the proudest day of my life."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No offense, but that's a real bummer of a life."
1,8,Michael,"Tahani, I'll get right to the crux of the matter."
1,8,Michael,Did you murder Janet?
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,Absolutely not.
1,8,Michael,"Now, you spent a lot of time with Eleanor."
1,8,Michael,Why do you think that is?
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, people are just drawn to me."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, one of my shyest friends, I won't say his name, to preserve his privacy, but he found my presence so comforting that he asked me to co-host his TV show Anderson Cooper 360."
1,8,Michael,"Given what you learned about Eleanor, do you think she deserves to be here?"
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well you know, if it were up to me, I might find a way to look past her, um deficiencies."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But it's not up to me, is it?"
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,There are some criteria that she unfortunately just didn't meet in her time on Earth.
1,8,Michael,So you think that I should send her to The Bad Place?
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I didn't say that, but is her staying here unfair to those who earned their place?"
1,8,Michael,It sounds like you want her to leave.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, is it not she who wants us to leave her?"
1,8,Michael,"Thank you, Tahani."
1,8,Michael,You've been a big help.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen up, genius."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's gonna call you in there in a second.
1,8,Jason Mendoza,"Don't worry, I got you."
1,8,Jason Mendoza,I'll just tell Michael you're the bomb and that you got a dope soul and hella ethics.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, don't say any of that."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael has a lie detector in there.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a glowing cube.
1,8,Jason Mendoza,Like the AllSpark?
1,8,Jason Mendoza,From Transformers?
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, just like the AllSpark from Transformers, and he'll know instantly if you're lying about anything so only smiles and nods, got it?"
1,8,Michael,"Wise, sage, centered Jianyu."
1,8,Michael,I seek your wisdom in this moment of crisis.
1,8,Michael,What to do with Eleanor?
1,8,Michael,Should I let her stay?
1,8,Michael,Should I send her away?
1,8,Michael,You think I should send her away?
1,8,Michael,"No, I should let her stay?"
1,8,Michael,"Or no, I shouldn't let her stay because she doesn't belong here?"
1,8,Michael,"Or no, I shouldn't let her stay even though she does belong here?"
1,8,Michael,"Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom."
1,8,Michael,"Your devotion to the noble truths has given you something that I don't have, clarity."
1,8,Michael,"It was Buddha who said, ""If a man lives a pure life."
1,8,Michael,"""Nothing can destroy him."""
1,8,Michael,"I'm not a man, and I've lived no life, so will this destroy me?"
1,8,Jason Mendoza,Ouch!
1,8,Michael,"Oh, of course."
1,8,Michael,A cactus on its own intends no harm.
1,8,Michael,It's only when we interfere that it becomes dangerous.
1,8,Michael,I need to remember my own agency here.
1,8,Michael,"Oh, thank you, Jianyu."
1,8,Michael,You're free to go.
1,8,Michael,"Oh, yes, of course."
1,8,Michael,Help yourself.
1,8,Michael,I've got plenty of those.
1,8,Michael,"Chidi, come on in."
1,8,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,8,Janet,I have Eleanor's file.
1,8,Michael,"Janet, if you hand me a cactus, I swear I will lose my mind."
1,8,Michael,"Oh, yes!"
1,8,Michael,"All right, here we go."
1,8,Michael,"Eleanor, come back in."
1,8,Michael,"Chidi, you stay here."
1,8,Michael,This file contains a compendium of all of the highest impact events from your life.
1,8,Michael,That's the biggest positive and negative point swings.
1,8,Michael,"So ""Little Julie"", who's that?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Julie is my cousin's daughter.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Her mom is kind of a mess, so I used to take her to the mall sometimes and bought her churro dogs."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's a hot dog, but the bun is two churros."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it's tied together with a Slim Jim.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's an Arizona delicacy.
1,8,Michael,"Oh, sounds awful, but it's very nice that you made that girl happy."
1,8,Michael,"So what's this ""Kool Threadz, ""Glendale, Arizona's Premiere T-Shirt Emporium""?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh can we skip around and circle back?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,How about I tell you more about those churro dogs?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
1,8,Michael,"Let's hear about the t-shirts, please."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll tell you, but it doesn't make me look great, so don't judge me."
1,8,Michael,That's literally the purpose of this entire exercise.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, to understand this, you have to know about my roommate, Madison."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,She was terrible.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Mads."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, I have to go to this stupid work party tonight."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I borrow your peach dress?
1,8,Madison,"Ooh, that's a hard no, babe."
1,8,Madison,That dress is like twice your salary.
1,8,Madison,"All right, I gotta go to the DMV and pick up my vanity plates."
1,8,Madison,"Ciao, bitches."
1,8,Michael,"Well, that's not great, but I assume you confessed and paid to fix it."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not exactly.
1,8,Madison,"Hey, losers, I'm going out."
1,8,Madison,Can you zip me?
1,8,Brittany,"Dude, that dress is hella ripped."
1,8,Madison,What?
1,8,Madison,"Oh, that stupid dry cleaner!"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's the risk you take when you keep your clothes clean."
1,8,Madison,My mom's a lawyer.
1,8,Madison,Those asswipes are gonna pay.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She sued for $900 for the dress and $80,000,000 in emotional distress."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,The legal fees drove the dry cleaner out of business.
1,8,Michael,"Oh, boy."
1,8,Michael,"Wait, this story's about t-shirts."
1,8,Michael,"There's more, isn't there?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,A little.
1,8,Brittany,Check this out.
1,8,Brittany,"Somebody put the dry cleaners' story online, and it went viral."
1,8,Brittany,Madison's famous.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The ""Dress Bitch""?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yikes.
1,8,Brittany,Serves her right.
1,8,Brittany,Madison is psycho.
1,8,Brittany,She totally overreacted.
1,8,Brittany,This is her fault.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, her fault."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,That works.
1,8,Madison,"You guys, what is happening?"
1,8,Madison,"Someone egged my Lexus, and I have like 40,000 tweets calling me the ""Dress Bitch""?"
1,8,Madison,Over a loser dry cleaner man?
1,8,Madison,Why is everyone so jealous of me?
1,8,Madison,"This is a trash city, full of idiots."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The ""Dress Bitch"" is so catchy."
1,8,Brittany,Yeah.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, someone could totally make t-shirts."
1,8,Brittany,Oh
1,8,Michael,"No, no."
1,8,Michael,No.
1,8,Michael,No.
1,8,Michael,Do not tell me that you made t-shirts that said that and then sold them for a profit?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wish I could tell you that, bud."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I really do.
1,8,Brittany,"Girl, check it out!"
1,8,Brittany,They're here.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wait a second.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is this insane?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, should we be doing this?"
1,8,Brittany,"Dude, Madison brought this on herself, okay?"
1,8,Brittany,She's a nightmare of a person to everybody.
1,8,Brittany,"Plus, we already have a ton of pre-orders."
1,8,Brittany,Here is your first cut of the profits.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy mama!
1,8,Michael,I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does it help if they basically sold themselves?
1,8,Michael,I think you know it does not.
1,8,Michael,What did you do with the money?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, babe."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Next question.
1,8,Michael,Eleanor.
1,8,Michael,"Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in The Good Place?"
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I don't."
1,8,Trevor,"Yello, Bad Place."
1,8,Trevor,"What's up, dummy?"
1,8,Michael,"This is Michael, the architect from Good Place Neighborhood 12358W."
1,8,Michael,I'm guessing you've been looking for someone called Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,8,Michael,She's here.
1,8,Michael,Come and get her.
1,8,Alexis,What is this?
1,8,Good Place Woman,Get out of here!
1,8,Michael,"Hello, Trevor."
1,8,Trevor,"Hey, there he is."
1,8,Trevor,"Good to see you again, Mikey."
1,8,Trevor,"Hey, think fast, I brought you something."
1,8,Michael,"Oh, nuts, thank you."
1,8,Michael,Oh!
1,8,Michael,"Oh, flaming snake ate all the nuts you brought me."
1,8,Trevor,Argh.
1,8,Trevor,You're too nice to humiliate.
1,8,Trevor,"Oh, hello."
1,8,Trevor,"Hi, you look like a piece of crap, are, are you Eleanor?"
1,8,Trevor,"Dude, you're like a legend in The Bad Place."
1,8,Trevor,You're check this out.
1,8,Trevor,Huh?
1,8,All,"""Dress Bitch""!"
1,8,Trevor,"It's pretty great, right?"
1,8,Michael,Trevor do you know what caused this mistake?
1,8,Michael,Cause I cannot figure it out.
1,8,Trevor,"No, we're stumped, but, don't sweat it, champ."
1,8,Trevor,She's definitely one of ours.
1,8,Trevor,"So we'll just roll on out, and you can get back to, putting rainbows up your butt or whatever you do here."
1,8,Trevor,Okay?
1,8,Trevor,"Let's hit it, sweetheart."
1,8,Trevor,We got a long ride.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right now?
1,8,Michael,"Trevor, for decency's sake, let her have some good-byes."
1,8,Trevor,"God, good people are the worst."
1,8,Trevor,"Okay, uh, 30 minutes."
1,8,Trevor,We gotta get back for The Bachelor.
1,8,Trevor,I'm gonna be pissed if I miss the Rose Ceremony.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I just want to say, once more, for the record, that this whole good/bad system is bull-shirt."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There should be a medium place for people like me who kind of sucked, but in, like, a fun, chill way."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,I agree.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,And that I never did laundry.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,And that I waited until you were about to do yours then secretly tossed mine into the basket to trick you into doing it.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,You didn't trick me.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,I repeatedly asked you to stop.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just know you did everything you could to help me.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're a really good fake soul mate.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you guys doing here?
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, we thought it was only proper to see you off."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's the neighborly thing to do.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys came to say good-bye because you're my friends.
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I suppose some part of me possibly has a sense of casual kinship with you."
1,8,Tahani Al-Jamil,Much as one might be fond of a street cat.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, Tahani."
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry about everything.
1,8,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm really glad we're friends.
1,8,Trevor,"Oh, hey, dum-dum."
1,8,Trevor,You ready to go?
1,8,Trevor,"Oh, you must be Chidi."
1,8,Trevor,Trying to improve her.
1,8,Trevor,"Bold plan, bro."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, actually, she learned a great deal in a very short amount of time --"
1,8,Trevor,"Oh, really?"
1,8,Trevor,Really?
1,8,Trevor,I don't care.
1,8,Trevor,"All right, let's hit it."
1,8,Trevor,"Oh, also, you should smile more."
1,8,Trevor,You have such a pretty smile.
1,8,Trevor,"Love you, babe."
1,8,Trevor,Can't wait to torture you.
1,8,Trevor,"This is the 3:18 to The Bad Place, making thousands of stops for literally no reason."
1,8,Trevor,"Now, you'll notice it's very hot in here, and it will get one degree hotter every time you think about how hot it is."
1,8,Trevor,Oops!
1,8,Trevor,You just thought about it.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,Michael
1,8,Michael,"Oh, hi, Chidi."
1,8,Michael,Want some pizza?
1,8,Michael,Bad Place crew delivered 100 of these to my office.
1,8,Michael,"All Hawaiian, the worst pizza."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, I murdered Janet."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,I knew about Eleanor from the beginning.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"I've been trying to help her become a better person, and when she found out that your retirement meant that you would be tortured, she immediately tried to find a way to prevent it."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor is learning.
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,She's just doing it after she died.
1,8,Michael,I did enjoy her company.
1,8,Michael,"But, this is not Little League."
1,8,Michael,"There is no award for ""Most Improved Player"", Chidi."
1,8,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, maybe there should be."
1,8,Trevor,"One final note, the dining car is at the very back of the train."
1,8,Trevor,"It serves only room-temperature Manhattan clam chowder, and also, it's closed."
1,8,Trevor,"Okay, here we go."
1,8,Michael,Stop this train!
1,8,Trevor,"Dude, what the fork?"
1,8,Michael,You're not leaving.
1,8,Michael,Not with her.
1,8,Michael,Not yet.
1,8,Michael,Come on.
1,8,Trevor,"Wait, you want to keep her?"
1,8,Trevor,"Bro, that's our girl."
1,8,Trevor,We agreed on this.
1,8,Michael,"No, what we agreed on was that this was a mistake."
1,8,Michael,"Trevor, we're in unchartered territory here."
1,8,Michael,"Until we can sort this out, she stays with us."
1,8,Trevor,"All right, fine, but until this is resolved, we're keeping the other Eleanor."
1,8,Michael,Fine.
1,8,Michael,What?
1,8,Michael,I'm sorry the other Eleanor?
1,8,Trevor,"Yeah, the real Eleanor."
1,8,Trevor,The one that was supposed to be here but got sent down to us instead?
1,8,Trevor,She's on the train.
1,8,Trevor,"Eleanor, come on out."
1,8,Real Eleanor,"Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor Shellstrop."
1,9,Trevor,"Hey, ding-dongs."
1,9,Trevor,We figured out what's happened here.
1,9,Trevor,You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,9,Trevor,"The day you died, you were both in Phoenix, Arizona, shopping at the same grocery store."
1,9,Michael,"The ""real"" Eleanor was attending a conference on the death penalty, and you stopped by to pick up food for a local homeless shelter."
1,9,Michael,"And Fake Eleanor was there buying margarita mix and a magazine called, ""Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters""."
1,9,Michael,"Incredibly, you both died in the same 10,000th of a second, in the same traffic accident, because Real Eleanor was trying to save Fake Eleanor's life by pushing you out of the way of the truck."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I guess you really botched that one, eh?"
1,9,Real Eleanor,"I did, and I am so, so sorry."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's all good.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"So, how did you not realize you had the wrong Eleanor?"
1,9,Michael,"Oh, we don't know what people look like, only names and profiles."
1,9,Michael,"On Earth, they're just dots on a map."
1,9,Trevor,"Whatever, we got our wires crossed, we picked up the wrong dot, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1,9,Trevor,"Point is, there are two Eleanors."
1,9,Trevor,"The nice, boring one is yours."
1,9,Trevor,The trash bag is ours.
1,9,Michael,Eh --
1,9,Trevor,"So, trash bag, let's go."
1,9,Trevor,Let's hit it.
1,9,Trevor,"And, also I'm still waiting on that smile, gorgeous."
1,9,Michael,Trevor.
1,9,Trevor,Where's that smile?
1,9,Michael,"Trevor, how about we negotiate."
1,9,Michael,Maybe give you something else?
1,9,Trevor,What in the world could you have that we would want?
1,9,Michael,"All right, how about a unicorn?"
1,9,Michael,Right?
1,9,Michael,I bet you don't have one of those.
1,9,Trevor,"No, that is true, yeah."
1,9,Trevor,"Might be fun to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh, maybe break off the horn, grind it up, snort it."
1,9,Trevor,"Okay, let's keep talking."
1,9,Trevor,Yeah.
1,9,Michael,"Fake Eleanor, a word?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's just me, man."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You can just say, ""Eleanor""."
1,9,Michael,"Sorry, it just makes things easier."
1,9,Michael,"Look, I'm not even sure how it would work for you to stay here now that we know there's a ""real"" Eleanor, but in the meantime, stay on your toes."
1,9,Michael,Don't let Trevor get inside your head.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I ask you something?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are you helping me?
1,9,Michael,"Well, Chidi made a very good argument on your behalf, but it's more than that."
1,9,Michael,I truly believe that The Good Place is where you belong.
1,9,Michael,You're part of our team.
1,9,Gloria,Hi!
1,9,Gloria,"Oh, you must be the new student Eleanor Shellstrop."
1,9,Gloria,"I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,9,Gloria,"Well, welcome to Adobe High, home of the Scorpi-otes!"
1,9,Gloria,"Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions, half wanted to be the Coyotes, so we compromised."
1,9,Gloria,Why don't I give you a tour after lunch?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no thanks, mop-top."
1,9,Gloria,"Uh, sorry?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't need your help, don't wanna sign your yearbook in, like, gel pen, don't wanna bedazzle our college essays, or whatever."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm here for like six months, and I'm gonna fly solo."
1,9,Jessica,"Beat it, Gloria."
1,9,Jessica,"She is, like, such a dork."
1,9,Jessica,"She, like, loves this school so much."
1,9,Jessica,Why don't you come sit with us?
1,9,Jessica,We'll teach you which guys are cute and which teachers are secretly pervs --
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, that's a hard pass as well."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't wanna get chunky highlights, make fun of nerds, and steal your mom's flavored vodka."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I get your whole ""mean girl"" thing, and I'm all set with it, thanks."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In fact listen up, everyone."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm Eleanor, I'm new here, and as a blanket statement for everyone, I don't wanna be a part of whatever little group you've formed because they're all equally lame."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everybody cool?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,9,Todd,"Hey, that was really cool, the way you told all those posers --"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, welcome."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,How can I help you?
1,9,Michael,"Well if I'm going to save Fake Eleanor, I need some help negotiating."
1,9,Michael,I don't even know what to offer.
1,9,Michael,"I mean, what do you get somebody who wants to eat a unicorn?"
1,9,Michael,"A unicorn bib, yes!"
1,9,Michael,"No, no, uh, unicorn holders, you know, like, like corn holders, but for unicorns?"
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Perhaps, it'd be better if we just move away from the unicorn thing altogether."
1,9,Michael,"No, you're right, you're right."
1,9,Michael,"And anyway, there's a bigger problem."
1,9,Michael,"The Bad Place Crew, they're all terrible bullies, and they outnumber me."
1,9,Michael,They even have their own Bad Janet.
1,9,Michael,I'll show you.
1,9,Michael,Bad Janet?
1,9,Bad Janet,What?
1,9,Michael,"Bad Janet, uh, where is the nearest cafe?"
1,9,Bad Janet,"Oh, um, that's a good question."
1,9,Bad Janet,"It's up your mom's butt, you fat dink."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,What is even the purpose of a Janet who behaves in such a manner?
1,9,Michael,"Unclear, but the the point is I never have to deal with negative emotion of any sort."
1,9,Michael,"I could use some backup, Tahani."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Michael, of course."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why don't you just bring them all here?
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Surely, this magnificent house will placate them."
1,9,Michael,"Oh, perfect, perfect."
1,9,Michael,I'll be right back.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, here's your house."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"It's beautiful, I love Icelandic primitive design."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"I kind of wish it had a clown nook, oh!"
1,9,Real Eleanor,There it is.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Here's the bedroom.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's kind of hard to get up on this dumb ledge though, it's like --"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have got to be forking kidding me.
1,9,Trevor,"Hey, Fake Eleanor, we used this same clown painting to decorate the room you were supposed to live in down there."
1,9,Trevor,I swear to Bieber.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, what was your house like?"
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Well, I was living in what I assume is Eleanor's worst nightmare."
1,9,Real Eleanor,Every day was basically one endless baby shower for a woman I didn't know.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"But also, somehow, I had to organize it."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"And, if I didn't remember everyone's name, I got a very strong electric shock."
1,9,Trevor,"Yep, that was my pitch."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"And, then at night, it was pretty classic torture."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Uh, flying piranhas, lava monsters, college improv, and there was always jazz music playing."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, I hate jazz."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Every jazz song is, like, 40 minutes long."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, we get it."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can blow on a trumpet.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wrap it up, Elton John."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Famously a piano player.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"I don't mean to be a bother, but could I possibly get some water and whatever food doesn't turn to spiders in your mouth?"
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, of course, so sorry."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Let's get some dinner.
1,9,Trevor,"Yeah, we'll all go."
1,9,Trevor,Perfect double date.
1,9,Trevor,"Two losers, a trash bag, and a demon."
1,9,Trevor,Let's hit it.
1,9,Trevor,Eeh!
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"All right, Michael, we're going to ply them with delicious food and drink, and then we're going to subtly segue into negotiation."
1,9,Michael,They're sure to be in a good mood.
1,9,Michael,Everything is absolutely beautiful.
1,9,Dana,"This sucks, dude."
1,9,Troy,"Yeah, this food, uh, blows."
1,9,Troy,"Yo, Good Janet."
1,9,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,9,Troy,"Oh, gimme some jalapeno poppers."
1,9,Janet,"Sure, quick question, what is a ""jalapeno""?"
1,9,Janet,"Also, what is a ""poppers""?"
1,9,Janet,"Also, what is ""jalapeno poppers""?"
1,9,Michael,Oops!
1,9,Michael,"Sorry, guys."
1,9,Michael,"See, in the confusion, Janet got rebooted, so she hasn't quite uploaded all of the info she usually knows."
1,9,Chad,That's hilarious.
1,9,Chad,She's almost as stupid as people.
1,9,Michael,"Oh, hey now, come on."
1,9,Michael,"Let's not insult people, please."
1,9,Troy,"I'm Michael, I love idiot humans!"
1,9,Michael,"I got to admit, that does sound like me."
1,9,Chad,"""I got to admit, that does sound like me."""
1,9,Michael,"Oh, nailed it again."
1,9,Dana,Go get me a drink.
1,9,Michael,"Yes, of course."
1,9,Trevor,"Ah, man, this is gonna make a primo dump later on."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that looks delicious."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,What is that?
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Oh, it's Tom Yum Goong soup."
1,9,Real Eleanor,It reminds me of when I was in Thailand rescuing victims of human trafficking.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, that sounds so good."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, the soup, not the human trafficking."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Oh, and I think your grilled eggplant looks so good."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Should we
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Splitsies?
1,9,Real Eleanor,Splitsies?
1,9,Real Eleanor,Yeah!
1,9,Trevor,I can't believe you thought you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.
1,9,Trevor,"She's like a perfect ball of light, and you're like a wet pile of mulch."
1,9,Trevor,"Someone made a person out of wet mulch and leaves and like, dead slugs, and that's you."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever, it's easy when you're just born perfect."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,My parents were both dirt bags who split up when I was eight.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"I don't mean to eavesdrop, but did you say your parents got a divorce?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, and that kind of thing really changes a person."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, that trauma it can explain away a lot of behavior."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Oh, of course."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Your parents are still together, I guess."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Oh, actually, I'm not sure."
1,9,Real Eleanor,I never met my birth parents.
1,9,Real Eleanor,They put me in an empty fish tank and abandoned me at a train station in Bangladesh.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Luckily, I was found and adopted by a very nice couple, the Shellstrops"
1,9,Trevor,"Oh, thank God."
1,9,Real Eleanor,But then they died when I was four bird flu.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,That's awful.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Anyway, orphanage burned down, yadda, yadda, yadda."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Made my way to America, yadda, yadda, yadda."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Learned English from watching Seinfeld, put myself through law school, and here I am."
1,9,Trevor,Huh.
1,9,Trevor,"And, I'm sorry, what what is it you said happened to you?"
1,9,Trevor,The same thing that happens to half of all kids in America?
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"And for you to have gone through all that, and to end up where you did, it is just it's just amazing."
1,9,Trevor,"Oh, man, these horn-dogs are vibing like mofos."
1,9,Trevor,"Am I right, Fake Eleanor?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Please, stop calling me that."
1,9,Trevor,"Oh, you got it, third wheel."
1,9,Trevor,"Yeah, that wine's no good."
1,9,Trevor,I'm sending it back.
1,9,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Janet."
1,9,Jason Mendoza,You look sad.
1,9,Janet,People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answers to.
1,9,Jason Mendoza,That was my whole life on Earth.
1,9,Jason Mendoza,"You know, it doesn't matter if you know things."
1,9,Jason Mendoza,All that matters is what's in your heart.
1,9,Janet,"Thanks, Jianyu."
1,9,Janet,"I mean, it does matter if I know things, because I'm an informational delivery system, and I don't have a heart, but thanks."
1,9,Janet,"Jianyu, I know usually you ask me questions, but can I ask you a question?"
1,9,Jason Mendoza,Sure.
1,9,Janet,What are jalapeno poppers?
1,9,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I know this one!"
1,9,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, they're deep fried jalapenos filled with cheese."
1,9,Jason Mendoza,"One time, at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville, but the nice one, not the one above the gas station, I ate 50 of them in two minutes."
1,9,Jason Mendoza,Everyone at the hospital was so impressed.
1,9,Janet,Got it.
1,9,Janet,"Thanks, Jianyu."
1,9,Jason Mendoza,You're welcome.
1,9,Janet,Why did you do that?
1,9,Jason Mendoza,Because you're the only person here that's nice to me.
1,9,Janet,Okay.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyone up for a little, uh, icebreaker?"
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I once did trust falls with Barry Diller, and it was the beginning of a lifelong friendship."
1,9,Michael,"And then, once we trust each other, then we can discuss making a deal for Fake Eleanor."
1,9,Dana,This sucks.
1,9,Dana,How do you guys eat without listening to hard-core porn?
1,9,Michael,"Oh, come on, this is The Good Place, you can do anything you want."
1,9,Chad,What about throwing a rager and totally trashing this place?
1,9,Troy,Woo-hoo.
1,9,Troy,"Yeah, I'd be into that."
1,9,Alexis,We could totally go to town.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I actually don't think that's such a good idea."
1,9,Michael,Let's party!
1,9,Chad,"Oh, my God!"
1,9,Real Eleanor,"So, um, Chidi tells me that he's teaching you about ethics."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, actually, we've had some interesting and in-depth classes."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He taught me about Plato and Socrates, Immanuel Kant --"
1,9,Trevor,"Yeah, cool, shut up."
1,9,Trevor,Let's cut to the chase here.
1,9,Trevor,You two go to Poundtown?
1,9,Trevor,"Poundtown, bro."
1,9,Trevor,You two bang it out?
1,9,Trevor,She hot for teach?
1,9,Trevor,Did you pork the dork?
1,9,Trevor,"C'mon, girl, dish me dem dirty deets."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"I assure you, our relationship was ""teacher-student"", nothing more."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Chidi, you don't have to explain anything to me."
1,9,Real Eleanor,Whatever happened before I arrived is none of my business.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Hey, I'd love to see the rest of the neighborhood."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, yes, it's incredible."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"There's an amazing library, there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"Well, please, show me everything."
1,9,Real Eleanor,"You ready, Eleanor?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've seen it all already.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys go ahead.
1,9,Real Eleanor,You'd rather be alone with him?
1,9,Trevor,Fire in the hole.
1,9,Trevor,"Watch your heads, ladies."
1,9,Trevor,My dudes tend to boomerang around the room.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I mean, I don't need to walk around and nerd out about old books."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm good.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,9,Casey,"Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see Spider-Man 2 tonight."
1,9,Casey,Do you want to come?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,They made a second Spider-Man?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is there left to say?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sure, whatever, I'm in."
1,9,Casey,"Cool, okay, well, I'll get tickets for the eight of us, and you can just pay me back in cash."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you can get all the points on your credit card, and the rest of us get screwed?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
1,9,Casey,"No, it's just so we can all get tickets before they sell out."
1,9,Casey,Do you want to buy them?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So you guys can never pay me back, and I'll be out like 80 bucks?"
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nice try.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll buy my own ticket.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,The rest of the group can do whatever they want.
1,9,Casey's Friend,Where did she end up?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bought it with points, baby."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,My points.
1,9,Casey,I think I need to find a new place to live.
1,9,Michael,"Oh no, no, no, no."
1,9,Michael,Don't don't
1,9,Michael,All right.
1,9,Dana,Want a bump?
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, thank you, I don't use cocaine."
1,9,Alexis,"Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot."
1,9,Alexis,We're snorting time.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry you're snorting the concept of time?
1,9,Dana,"Yeah, it'll fork you up."
1,9,Troy,"Yo, monk dude, you know how to tap a keg?"
1,9,Chad,Karaoke time!
1,9,Dana,Whoo!
1,9,Chad,"Dana, baby, what do you wanna do?"
1,9,Chad,"Okay, Mussolini's speech?"
1,9,Chad,"Ooh, the Mel Gibson rant?"
1,9,Chad,That's a classic.
1,9,Dana,Classic
1,9,Dana,Ooh!
1,9,Dana,Let's do the Nixon tapes.
1,9,Dana,That's my jam!
1,9,Chad,Yeah!
1,9,Nixon's Voice,"""What you always have to remember about the Irish is they get mean."
1,9,Nixon's Voice,"""Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks."""
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, tell them to stop."
1,9,Michael,"Oh, I think I made it pretty clear that I don't approve."
1,9,Dana,"Hey, idiot."
1,9,Dana,Dance.
1,9,Michael,You got it.
1,9,Nixon's Voice,"""Oh, it's about damn time that the Jew in America realizes he's an American first and a Jew second."""
1,9,Trevor,"I lighted him on fire, and he never spoke again."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, maybe I'm not as great as Real Eleanor, but I'm better than I used to be."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm medium-good.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why haven't you forkers invented a medium place?
1,9,Trevor,"Look, I know you've been trying to become a ""better person"", I mean, you didn't want to get caught."
1,9,Trevor,I get it.
1,9,Trevor,"But, I read your file you don't belong here."
1,9,Trevor,"I mean, she spent her weekends breaking up dog fighting rings."
1,9,Trevor,"You once saw a meter maid writing you a ticket, and you barked like a dog till she ran away."
1,9,Trevor,"I mean, honestly, you'll be happier in The Bad Place."
1,9,Trevor,"I mean, don't get me wrong, you'll be miserable."
1,9,Trevor,"We will torture you, but you'll also be happier."
1,9,Trevor,Because you won't have to keep trying to fit in somewhere you just don't belong.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right!
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
1,9,Trevor,"Okay, hold on, I have to ask, is this thing gonna happen?"
1,9,Trevor,You and me?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ew, no, gross."
1,9,Trevor,"Okay, you know I had to ask, babe."
1,9,Michael,"Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry."
1,9,Michael,I will obviously clean all of this up.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I don't care about the house, Michael."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm just upset that you let them walk all over you.
1,9,Michael,I know they're the only thing in the Universe that scares me.
1,9,Michael,I know what I have to do.
1,9,Michael,I just have to be more accommodating.
1,9,Michael,"Offer them everything they want, give in to all of their demands, and then they'll have to respect me."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, you need to stand up for yourself."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told Mark Zuckerberg right before he ousted Eduardo Saverin.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You are smart, you are capable, and the time has come to hit ""unfriend""."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I also told Mark to lose the ""the""."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Just ""Facebook""."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was me.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, my head."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Here, drink this."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,How am I hung over?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought there were no hangovers here.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, The Bad Place Crew requested that the hangover filter be turned off."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,They like them.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Michael said we're meeting at Tahani's place in an hour for a negotiation session."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,We'll walk over together?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You don't have to come, man."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm good.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just hang out with Real Eleanor and name constellations after each other, or whatever it is nerds do."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm fine on my own.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, Eleanor, just because we have a new guest in the house doesn't mean I'm not still gonna be there for you."
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,I'm in this.
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,We're a team.
1,9,Dwayne DeRock,"So, you've been temping for us for a year now, and we want to bring you aboard permanently."
1,9,Dwayne DeRock,We think you'd be a great addition to the team.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah no.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm good.
1,9,Dwayne DeRock,You're turning it down?
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just don't think I'm really one of you guys.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're all obsessed with this place, man."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You love working here and talking about working here, and you all hang out like some kind of cult."
1,9,Dwayne DeRock,We hang out after work because we're friends.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's weird.
1,9,Dwayne DeRock,"If this is how you really feel, I think I have to fire you."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Severance pay.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Love it.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good looking out, boss."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Peace!
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I get it, man."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which one's my desk?
1,9,Wallace,"That one, over there."
1,9,Wallace,All you gotta do is hit your minimal sales target every week.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you guys don't have any lame, mandatory office hangouts, right?"
1,9,Wallace,Hell no.
1,9,Wallace,"Some people go out for a drink after work, and I like to run the occasional group drill to see how fast we can shred evidence, but that's it."
1,9,Wallace,"Most days, you'll be able to avoid even talking to another person here."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Perfect.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,Happy to be a part of the not-team.
1,9,Wallace,It'll be a pleasure not hanging out with you.
1,9,Michael,"All right, let's begin negotiations."
1,9,Michael,"Now, we would like to discuss various trades that we could --"
1,9,Trevor,"Oh, yeah, we're not negotiating."
1,9,Trevor,"See, Fake Eleanor and I, we bro-ed down pretty hard last night."
1,9,Trevor,We hooked up.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, we didn't."
1,9,Trevor,"Yeah, but who are they gonna believe me or a woman?"
1,9,Trevor,"Point is, she knows that she doesn't belong here, and she's giving up."
1,9,Michael,"Is this true, Fake Eleanor?"
1,9,Michael,Are you giving up?
1,9,Trevor,"Yeah, of course she is."
1,9,Trevor,She knows this place isn't for her.
1,9,Trevor,"Let's go, ding-dong."
1,9,Trevor,Come on.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm not leaving."
1,9,Trevor,"Oh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this."
1,9,Trevor,You know you don't belong here.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're right.
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't but, I want to."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I used to never want to be a part of any group, but I'm a different person now, because of the person who helped me, and I want to be like him."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,I want to be like all the people who are here.
1,9,Real Eleanor,"You can, Eleanor."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, Real Eleanor."
1,9,Trevor,"Hey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up."
1,9,Trevor,"Look, if you don't come with us, we're gonna have to turn this matter over to Shawn."
1,9,Michael,"Oh, oh, no!"
1,9,Michael,"Shawn, really?"
1,9,Chidi Anagonye,Who's Shawn?
1,9,Michael,"He's the wise, eternal Judge who sits on high, has the final say on all disputes between our two realms."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,And his name is Shawn?
1,9,Trevor,"Okay, look, I don't want Shawn involved either."
1,9,Trevor,"So, how about you blow us away with an offer, so we can end this."
1,9,Michael,Okay here's my offer.
1,9,Michael,You get nothing!
1,9,Michael,"We're not letting Fake Eleanor go, and we're not giving you anything."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Get him, Michael!"
1,9,Michael,"You can summon every evil creature you have, every weapon in your arsenal, every four-headed flying bear."
1,9,Michael,They have them down there.
1,9,Michael,"But, we are not giving up."
1,9,Michael,I believe that Eleanor belongs in The Good Place.
1,9,Michael,"If I'm wrong, you can take her to The Bad Place and punish her all you want, just really go to town on her."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Gah, gah, gah."
1,9,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Easy, buddy, easy."
1,9,Michael,"But, she's staying here."
1,9,Michael,"Now, all of you get the fork out of my neighborhood."
1,9,Trevor,"You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor."
1,9,Trevor,Enjoy it while it lasts.
1,9,Trevor,"Let's roll, dummies."
1,9,Dana,Bye.
1,9,Alexis,Did you guys here any of that?
1,9,Michael,"Oh, my"
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Bravo, Michael, really."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Jianyu."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,You got sloppy.
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I found your junk food all over the house, and then, last night, you knew how to tap a keg."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, I thought I would come in here and investigate your little ""meditation"" den."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, what I found was this."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now, I don't know who you are, but I do know that you're not a Buddhist monk."
1,9,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, let's chat, shall we?"
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Number five is number one.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Number seven is number two.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Number three and number four are tied for number three.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,What are you talking about?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I'm ranking my favorite Fast and the Furious movies.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"You said you wanted to know who I am, and this is the best way to get to know me."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, it isn't."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You could tell me your real name, for starters."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,My name is Jason Mendoza.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"I'm from Florida and I'm a professional, amateur deejay."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, is that a family member?"
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I wish.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"That's Ariana Grande, the sexiest woman alive."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You wish that you were related to a woman you want to have sex with.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You know what?
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk, but you're barely even a regular, functioning person."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did you get here?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"I don't know, but, please, dawg, you can't tell Michael about me."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You have some nerve asking me for favors when you have spent weeks deceiving me, making a fool out of me, and bringing snack food into my house."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Disgusting!
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now."
1,10,Michael,"Shawn, the judge, could show up at any moment, so we need to have a rock-solid argument for why Fake Eleanor should not be sent to The Bad Place."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Should be fun.
1,10,Michael,That's the spirit!
1,10,Michael,Don't even think about the fact that our slightest misstep could cause Fake Eleanor to suffer for eternity.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,That's all I'm thinking about now.
1,10,Michael,"Yep, shouldn't have said that."
1,10,Michael,Regretted it immediately.
1,10,Michael,"Bambadjan was a human rights advocate, so he and Real Eleanor will build a sort of legal argument."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um could you please just say, ""Eleanor""?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,And maybe point to whichever one of us you're addressing?
1,10,Bambadjan,"Well, actually, the fake/real distinction helps me."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, does it, Bambadjan?"
1,10,Real Eleanor,"Now, I know a fair amount about your time on Earth."
1,10,Real Eleanor,Why don't you tell me about your time here?
1,10,Real Eleanor,Anything that might help your case.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, in the first 24 hours, I caused the world to erupt into chaos, and then I caused a garbage storm."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It was kind of a rough start, but things calmed down after Chidi started helping me learn about ethics."
1,10,Real Eleanor,"Okay, tell me about that."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I studied with Chidi every day, and then Chidi got sick of me, so I did some nice stuff to make him feel better."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And later, I confessed because Chidi was being tortured by guilt, and I just felt awful, seeing his little, nerdy face all contorted."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomach ache because of what you did."""
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,He is such a dork.
1,10,Real Eleanor,"You know, uh, a lot of death row inmates feel regret about things they never said, admissions of guilt, or anger, or love."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you making a move on me?
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's fine.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just didn't see it coming.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh well, hooking up with someone with the exact same name, it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy --"
1,10,Real Eleanor,"No, no, Eleanor, I'm talking --"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I could be into it.
1,10,Real Eleanor,Mmm.
1,10,Real Eleanor,"No, I'm talking about you and Chidi."
1,10,Real Eleanor,"Now, ordinarily, you having feelings for my soul mate would be a conflict of interest --"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,You think I'm into Chidi?
1,10,Real Eleanor,"Yes, Eleanor, I do."
1,10,Real Eleanor,Because you are.
1,10,Bambadjan,You mentioned his name nine times in the last ten minutes.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nobody asked you, Bambadjan."
1,10,Michael,"I'm not sure what will work with Shawn, but we should have all our bases covered."
1,10,Michael,"Shall we start with the Greeks, or would you prefer the modern British masters?"
1,10,Michael,Chidi?
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, choices are hard for me when I'm under pressure."
1,10,Michael,"I know that, buddy, but we're short of time here, and it's kind of important for Eleanor."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Right, which is why I can't take this lightly."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,What if I screw up?
1,10,Michael,"Listen, I don't need the Chidi who once had a panic attack during Rock-Paper-Scissors because there were, and I quote, ""just too many variables""."
1,10,Michael,I need the Chidi who stormed in here and told me to stop Eleanor's train without thinking of consequences.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy, now I'm nervous about that decision."
1,10,Michael,Retroactively?
1,10,Michael,"I mean, how do you even?"
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
1,10,Michael,"Okay, we have so many big choices to make."
1,10,Michael,Let's start small.
1,10,Michael,Do you want to use a dry erase board or the regular pen and paper?
1,10,Michael,Just pick.
1,10,Young Uzo,"Chidi, just pick!"
1,10,Young Uzo,"Come on, Chidi, pick someone."
1,10,Young Chidi,"Don't pressure me, Uzo."
1,10,Young Chidi,I have to consider all the factors.
1,10,Young Chidi,"Athletic strategies, the fragile egos of my classmates, and gender politics."
1,10,Young Chidi,"Should I pick a girl as a gesture towards women's equality, or is that pandering?"
1,10,Young Chidi,Or do I think it's pandering because of my limited male point of view?
1,10,Young Chidi,"I'm vexed, Uzo, vexed."
1,10,Young Uzo,You're always vexed.
1,10,Young Uzo,Just pick.
1,10,Young Chidi,"Okay, fine, I choose Tokunbo."
1,10,Young Uzo,You can't draft the teacher.
1,10,Young Uzo,Pick a kid.
1,10,Kid,"Come on, Chidi."
1,10,Kid,Just pick someone.
1,10,Young Uzo,"Congratulations, Chidi."
1,10,Young Uzo,You filibustered recess.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, no, you're wrong."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,There are way more things I hate about Chidi than like about him.
1,10,Real Eleanor,Like what?
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"His stupid Clark Kent glasses, his extensive turtleneck collection, oh, and he loves ethics so much."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,He once talked about John Rawls for two hours.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I timed it.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, he only stopped because he saw me timing him."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Granted, he laughed, and kind of made fun of himself, it was a nice moment, but still."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He always twitches his eyebrows when he says ""absolutism"", and he tilts his head whenever I say anything ignorant, but he never makes fun of me, which is nice."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's also incredibly patient, and kind, and surprisingly jacked, and, oh, fork, I'm in love with Chidi."
1,10,Real Eleanor,Let's take a little break.
1,10,Real Eleanor,"I know this is awkward, but as your advocate, and, I hope, friend, I think you should tell Chidi how you feel."
1,10,Bambadjan,Would a hug make you feel better?
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I don't think that it would --"
1,10,Bambadjan,"Oh, too late, you're getting one."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, Bambadjan, that does make me feel better."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yet another lie.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You didn't paint this.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You got Janet to do it.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"No, no, no, Chidi did it."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"I got you an awesome painting, but then he switched it to this one because he said you'd like it more, and he made me memorize stuff to say to you so you wouldn't be so sad."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,This is all his fault.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,You should yell at him.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Chidi helped you make me happy.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's almost as if he was trying to --
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh oh, my."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,This is the cool painting I made.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,This guy's famous.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, who even are those ladies?"
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic."
1,10,Michael,Wow.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ethics team, how's it going?"
1,10,Michael,Terribly.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you guys are kind of my last hope, so that's not great."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, do you mind if I borrow Professor Stomach Ache here for a second?"
1,10,Michael,"Please, take him for an hour, take all the time you want."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, sit down, maybe."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I dated many annoying guys, okay?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They would call me all times of the day ""just to talk"" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Usually, wouldn't even call or anything."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'd just bounce.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Gotta go spend that money you stole.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Point is, you are way more of a buzz kill than any of those dudes."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, thanks for this conversation."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, somehow, I never want to leave you."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I want to stay in The Good Place because of you.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because I love you.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm pretty sure."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I love you."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, that's embarrassing."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I feel so itchy.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't say anything.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just needed to get that off my chest.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I'm gonna go."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Catch you later, silly billy."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Love has made me a nerd.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bye.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jianyu's a fake.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,He's not supposed to be here.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Just like your ""soul mate""."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"More importantly, you did the ballerina painting 'cause you were trying to protect my feelings, because you love me."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Chidi, don't you see?"
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is the real mistake that was made in our neighborhood.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You and I are soul mates.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It makes so much sense.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, but --"
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, Chidi, true love is rare, like a desert flower betwixt two oases, but true love's also very simple."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, right now, I'm just a girl, towering over a boy, asking him to admit he loves me."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I feel like her confession of love was a lot better than mine.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I get a do-over?
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"I need to step outside for some air, and I will not be back for many days."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you can't just run away."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have to
1,10,Zach Czytchu,"It looks calm now, but the storm is imminent."
1,10,Zach Czytchu,We're --
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"What's up, Carson Daly?"
1,10,Jason Mendoza,My name is Jason.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I wanna give a shout-out to all my homies up in Jacksonville.
1,10,Zach Czytchu,I am not Carson Daly.
1,10,Zach Czytchu,I'm a weather reporter.
1,10,Zach Czytchu,A hurricane is coming.
1,10,Zach Czytchu,You need to seek shelter.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I'm on TV!
1,10,Zach Czytchu,Okay.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Janet?"
1,10,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,10,Janet,What are you watching?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,My greatest accomplishment ever.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I'm trying to cheer myself up because I'm sad.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I think I might be in big trouble.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Can you bring me something that will make me not sad?
1,10,Janet,Let me think.
1,10,Janet,Sorry that took so long.
1,10,Janet,Here you go.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dang."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Are these from my favorite restaurant, Stupid Nick's Wing Dump?"
1,10,Janet,Stupid Nick's closed down because a pelican fell in the flash fryer.
1,10,Janet,"But, he opened a new place, called Ugly Nick's Meat Trench."
1,10,Janet,These are an exact replica of that recipe.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Why are you so nice to me?
1,10,Janet,"Well, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting."
1,10,Janet,"Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Janet?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I just realized something.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I love you.
1,10,Janet,Okay.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I have one more question for you.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, you also love Chidi, and you just told him, just now, right before I did?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Technically, you told him that he loves you, but yes."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,This isn't ideal.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,We must remain civil.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He's simply going to have to pick one of us, and the loser will just have to accept her fate, with grace and equanimity."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe if you lose.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If he doesn't pick me, I'mma start throwing stuff."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Classy as always.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, I did."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Figured you two charlatans would sniff each other out like two mangy rats sharing a pizza crust in a sewer --
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay no.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're not gonna do this.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We are not gonna be those women who fight over a guy, and find any excuse to rip each other apart."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am not going to apologize for being angry.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,You knew that my soul mate was lying to me.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, I did, and I'm very sorry."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, you and I have a weird, complicated, forked-up friendship, but it's our friendship, and I care about it."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's do something fun.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What would make you feel happy, right now?"
1,10,Margaret,"You have a fine home, Deirdre."
1,10,Margaret,I absolutely adore your chaise.
1,10,Deirdre,I don't know bugger all about a chaise --
1,10,Deirdre,"I been using this as a bloody toilet, I have."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's this show called, again?"
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's Deirdre and Margaret.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It ran for 16 years on the BBC.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,They did nearly 30 episodes.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's about two women from very different worlds who become friends, sort of like us."
1,10,Margaret,"Oh, Deirdre, no!"
1,10,Margaret,That's priceless art!
1,10,Deirdre,"I thought it was fruit, innit?"
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Deirdre.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I take it the moron is me?
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, it's not a direct parallel."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, we did your thing."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, it's my turn."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you ready to take our bonding to the next level?
1,10,Michael,"Oh, good, you're back."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"I, uh I know we're short on time, but I need your help with a personal dilemma."
1,10,Michael,This is about Fake Eleanor and Real Eleanor.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Which person is my soul mate?
1,10,Michael,"Real Eleanor, that's what the system determined."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,10,Michael,"Of course, the system did screw up by letting Fake Eleanor in."
1,10,Michael,"You know, it's interesting."
1,10,Michael,Fake Eleanor being selected accidentally and then you bonding with her could have shifted the formula.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"But, it's one of those two people."
1,10,Michael,"Well, I I don't know."
1,10,Michael,"I mean, the system might be so screwed up at this point, that maybe you don't belong to either Eleanor."
1,10,Michael,You is spreading
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,10,Michael,Your indecisiveness is infecting me like a virus.
1,10,Michael,"Oh, Chidi, this could send us down a very dangerous path."
1,10,Michael,"If you can't make a choice, this whole neighborhood could fall apart."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, getting close here."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Just mulling the ethical ramifications of various soups.
1,10,Uzo,"Oh, same old Chidi."
1,10,Gawlff,I can come back for a fifth time.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,How are you?
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Uzo, it's been too long."
1,10,Uzo,"It has, it has."
1,10,Uzo,"Look, as you know, Ellen and I are engaged."
1,10,Uzo,"You're my oldest friend, and I love you like a brother, and that's why I'd like you to not be my best man."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry?
1,10,Uzo,"Look, if you were my best man, you'd have to plan the bachelor party, decide what to say in your toast, handle problems that pop up the day of."
1,10,Uzo,It would drive you up the wall.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams on a playground."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"When something's important to me, I can make a decision."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Watch.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, excuse me, excuse me."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.
1,10,Gawlff,Perfect.
1,10,Uzo,You kind of want to change your order.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking."
1,10,Uzo,Yeah.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Excuse me, risotto."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Risotto?
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As much as I'm enjoying this, shouldn't we be working on your case to try and stay here?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, how am I gonna help them?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,They are much smarter than me.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, hair extensions?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is where I shine.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You were already at almost-maximum hotness, but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,The dream.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, how exactly did you learn how to do this?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"These were the ones I used, and they are real cheap."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're gonna want to stay away from open flames, and altercations at outlet malls."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu, and that you got saddled with him."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, that is regrettable, but I forgive you."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Maybe you two are soul mates.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy shirt.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe we are.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know it seems crazy, but think about it, Jianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We both love to dance, we were both banned from public transit systems in our cities."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think this is the answer!
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"People come in pairs here, and if the system paired us up, then maybe somehow I do belong here with him."
1,10,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,10,Janet,"Jason and I are getting married in ten minutes, and you're invited."
1,10,Michael,"Here, we've got your soul mate options, Eleanor, Real Eleanor, and a theoretical third person."
1,10,Michael,Let's call her strawberry mango twist.
1,10,Michael,"Okay, close your eyes."
1,10,Michael,Think about each of the women.
1,10,Michael,Open your eyes.
1,10,Michael,The answer is Real Eleanor.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,How do you know?
1,10,Michael,"I don't, but the minute I said that, you knew instinctively whether it felt right."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, hang on, let me think about that."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Because it --
1,10,Michael,"No, no."
1,10,Michael,"No more thinking, Chidi."
1,10,Michael,Just do something.
1,10,Michael,"Indecision caused you so much agony in your life, right up to the very end."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I had a little trouble writing my speech.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, I wrote 11 different versions."
1,10,Uzo,"Wedding's in 20 minutes, buddy."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I'm really hot!
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Is this air-conditioner even working?
1,10,Uzo,"Yes, it is."
1,10,Uzo,You're just having a literal meltdown.
1,10,Uzo,"Also, you're not dressed yet, and we haven't picked up the rings."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, well, there's an issue there."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, involving what I consider to be unfair labor practices on the part of the jeweler."
1,10,Uzo,And we never had a bachelor party because you could never settle on a location or time.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,You were right.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,This is too much for me.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,You should just leave me here and go get married.
1,10,Uzo,"Yeah, here's the thing, bud, my wedding isn't for another month."
1,10,Uzo,"This was a test to see if you could handle being my best man, and, just as I predicted, you failed, miserably."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I mean, I'm relieved, but this is embarrassing."
1,10,Uzo,"It's okay, bud."
1,10,Uzo,"Obviously, I prepared for this."
1,10,Uzo,Let's just go have a nice night.
1,10,Uzo,I'll buy you a beer.
1,10,Uzo,"Thirty minutes, Chidi?"
1,10,Uzo,We've been trying to pick a bar for 30 minutes.
1,10,Uzo,It is literally impossible to be your friend.
1,10,Uzo,You're incapable of making a single decision.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect --"
1,10,Uzo,Chidi?
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,You're right.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,I just need to make decision.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm gonna look each of these women in the eye, trust my gut, and figure out how I feel."
1,10,Michael,You're kidding.
1,10,Michael,That worked?
1,10,Michael,Great!
1,10,Michael,Go do it!
1,10,Michael,Ha!
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to marry!"
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, check it."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is great.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At different moments during our time here, we both thought that Tragic Mike over here was our one true love, and now he is marrying whatever Janet is."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,I suppose you're right.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It is a bit strange.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,I'd like to read a poem.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, my digital queen,"
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, we can dare to dream."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Send nude pics of your heart to me.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Jacksonville Jaguars rule!
1,10,Janet,"Jason, when I was rebooted, and I lost all my knowledge, I was confused and disoriented, but you were always kind to me."
1,10,Janet,"And, according to the central theme of 231,600 songs, movies, poems, and novels that I researched for these vows in the last three seconds, that's what love's all about."
1,10,Janet,Does anybody here object to this marriage?
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, it is a terrible idea."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course we do.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could we not object?
1,10,Janet,Overruled.
1,10,Janet,Jason?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Mmm-hmm.
1,10,Janet,Do you want me to be your wife?
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
1,10,Janet,I want you to be my husband.
1,10,Jason Mendoza,Tight.
1,10,Janet,"So, by the power vested in me, by me, I now pronounce us husband and wife."
1,10,Jason Mendoza,We did it!
1,10,Jason Mendoza,"Can I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted?"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Only one way to find out.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get some!
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Go get it, girl!"
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just going with it now.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's funny.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was devastated when I found out that he wasn't my soul mate, but now I think I've dodged a bullet."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,He's a simple man.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I once watched him eat electrical tape right off the roll.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,He thought it was a Fruit by the Foot that had gone bad.
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you for being such a great friend to me today.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Of course, hot stuff."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got your back.
1,10,Real Eleanor,"Eleanor, hey, I just wanted to see if you'd talked to Chidi."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, yeah, I did."
1,10,Real Eleanor,"I mean, you don't have to tell me what you said."
1,10,Real Eleanor,I just wanted to see if you're okay.
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man, you are a good person."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I swear, if I had known you and Tahani and Chidi on Earth, I might have for real gotten into The Good Place."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, it's my three favorite yogurts."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, um, about what happened earlier I've been kind of all over the place today."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"An hour ago, I thought Jianyu was my soul mate, and the fact that that kind of made sense means you and I could never be meant for each other."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I do love you, but I think more in a best friend, afterlife-savior kind of way."
1,10,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm not so much ""hot for teacher"" as I am eternally grateful for ""semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher""."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi, I also have to apologize."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's just that when I found out that Jianyu wasn't my soul mate, I desperately needed something to keep me afloat, and, well, you were the nearest lifeboat, as it were."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And, yes, we do have the sort of connection that only two highly-educated sophisticates could have, but it's not true love."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,True love is what Janet and Jianyu have.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, we would love to stay and chat, but we need to find Michael."
1,10,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, I think I figured out a way for you to stay."
1,10,Real Eleanor,Really?
1,10,Real Eleanor,"I'll come, too."
1,10,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,11,Michael,"Now, I'm about to show you some very sensitive information."
1,11,Michael,The final point totals each of you achieved for all your actions on Earth.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Whoa, your point total was crazy high, Eleanor."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry, ""Crazy High Eleanor"" was my nickname in college."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,I accidentally saw these point totals when Michael was fixing the sinkhole.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,It gave me an idea.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We will apply the formula to Eleanor's actions here in The Good Place, and if you earn enough new points, then we could argue that you should stay here."
1,11,Real Eleanor,Would that work?
1,11,Michael,"Don't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before."
1,11,Michael,"But the judge will be here soon, and this is the best way to build our case."
1,11,Michael,"Now, the average point total for a resident here is roughly 1.2 million."
1,11,Michael,"Right now, based on everything that you did on Earth, you have -4,008."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's not great, but I'm gonna do nice things for every goober in this place until my point total is so high I can rub it in all their smug faces."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,You just lost five points.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hello!
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, how are you?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,There has to be something bigger I can do than holding the door and waving.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no way every Walmart greeter is in The Good Place.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Walmart""?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a place regular people go.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,You haven't heard of it.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I know this is tedious, but holding a door for someone is three points, and if you do it for everyone in the neighborhood, then that's almost a 1,000 points for just a start."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Besides, all the big-ticket items are impossible, I'm afraid."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's not as if you could, you know, ""sacrifice your life to save others"" or ""change the consciousness of a nation""."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Both of which I did, by the way."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have a wonderful day.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is pointless!
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The ticker isn't even going up, and everyone's giving me the stink eye."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, everyone hates you."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, fork you too."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, this is good."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now that we know, we can actually do something about it."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I am an expert at mediating conflict, like when my friends Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby had an issue with my other friend, Archbishop Desmond Tutu."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hard-boiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine."
1,11,Real Eleanor,"Um, actually, this morning, there's a little surprise in yours."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"""I love you."""
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,How cute.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you too, egg."
1,11,Real Eleanor,"Oh, no."
1,11,Real Eleanor,"No, Chidi, that's me saying that to you."
1,11,Real Eleanor,I love you.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh well, that is something."
1,11,Real Eleanor,"I know you've gone through a lot, and now I'm throwing this at you, but I just I had to tell you how I feel."
1,11,Real Eleanor,I love you.
1,11,Real Eleanor,No need to respond.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
1,11,Real Eleanor,"Well, at some point, you'll respond, right?"
1,11,Real Eleanor,I just meant no rush.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,You wanna talk about eggs again?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Mmm this isn't right.
1,11,Janet,"I'm sorry, I've never kissed anyone before."
1,11,Janet,Is one tongue okay?
1,11,Janet,I can add more tongues.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"No, that's not it."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"We're married now, but we still haven't told your dad."
1,11,Janet,"Once again, Michael is not my dad, and we shouldn't tell him."
1,11,Janet,"If Michael finds out that we're married, then he'll know you're not Tahani's soulmate, and then he'll know that you're really Jason and not Jianyu."
1,11,Janet,He'd send you to The Bad Place.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Hmm, I don't want to lose you, girl."
1,11,Janet,I'm not a girl.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"But also, I'm tired of living a lie."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,We gotta go public.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I hate all this hiding.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I want us to have the life we deserve.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Pillboi, let's talk big picture."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,You know I love Jacksonville.
1,11,Pillboi,J-town.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"It's easily one of the top ten swamp cities in northeastern Florida, but if we're gonna make it in the DJ game, we gotta get to Miami."
1,11,Pillboi,"Oh, yeah, but Miami's expensive."
1,11,Pillboi,"We just don't got that skrilla, B."
1,11,Pillboi,"I mean, I got ten bucks to my name, and I spent eight of it on this burrito, and the other two on guac."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I know what we gotta do.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,We're gonna rob this restaurant.
1,11,Pillboi,Great idea!
1,11,Pillboi,But what if we get caught?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Then we'll just get married, so that no one can testify against us."
1,11,Pillboi,Dope!
1,11,Pillboi,"Yo I got diarrhea, I'll be right back."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Me too.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I'll race you.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Best friends!
1,11,Pillboi,Best friends!
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you all for participating in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Think of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.
1,11,Jessica,"I was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, dear."
1,11,Jessica,"All this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin."
1,11,Jessica,I didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing."
1,11,Pilar,"My cafe got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole."
1,11,Glenn,Just like me.
1,11,Glenn,"I fell in, too."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who else feels that Eleanor has ruined every moment of your existence since you arrived?
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excellent.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I must confer with Eleanor for a tick, so please, just enjoy the lemonade and cookies."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,It seems everyone's problem with me is me.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, it would appear that way."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,The last moment that they were happy was at my party.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to recreate that party.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to take them back to that night before I started affecting the neighborhood and give them a fresh start.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, of course."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We must throw the perfect party, or else you'll be tortured by demons forever."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,This will be the fourth most important party I have ever thrown.
1,11,Michael,"Janet, there you are."
1,11,Michael,Some residents are complaining that you're not responding
1,11,Michael,"I'm sorry, what's going on?"
1,11,Michael,Is that a wedding ring?
1,11,Janet,Yes.
1,11,Janet,I'm married.
1,11,Michael,To whom?
1,11,Janet,"I'm sorry, my protocol forbids me from telling you any private information about any resident."
1,11,Michael,Is it that person?
1,11,Michael,"Jianyu, the man standing right there, also wearing a wedding band?"
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Dad we need to talk.
1,11,Michael,I just want to make sure that I have this right.
1,11,Michael,"Uh, Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk, but rather someone named Jason Mendoza, a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"I wasn't a failed DJ, I was pre-successful."
1,11,Michael,And you two are married.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Hells yeah, homey."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,We love each other.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,She makes the bass drop in my heart.
1,11,Janet,"And Jason is a person who was near me, and then he asked me to marry him, and there is nothing in my protocol that specifically barred that from happening."
1,11,Janet,So I agreed.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Love you too, babe."
1,11,Michael,Janet.
1,11,Michael,Please tell me how this could have happened.
1,11,Janet,Unclear.
1,11,Janet,"As you know, each time I am updated, I accrue new knowledge and abilities."
1,11,Janet,"My suspicion is that when I was rebooted, I bonded with Jason in a way that I have never bonded with anyone before."
1,11,Janet,I seem to have gained a new understanding of love.
1,11,Janet,I also learned how to do this.
1,11,Michael,I will speak to you later.
1,11,Michael,Go to your void.
1,11,Janet,Okay.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"No, Janet, come back!"
1,11,Janet,Hi there.
1,11,Michael,Go.
1,11,Janet,Sure thing.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,No!
1,11,Michael,Stop doing that.
1,11,Janet,Me?
1,11,Michael,Go!
1,11,Janet,Goodbye.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, come back."
1,11,Janet,I love you.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I love you too!
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That is Sachveer, and his problem with me is oh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's gonna be hard to keep a straight face tonight.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, can I ask your advice on something?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are you sure, dude?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Isn't there someone else better you could ask, like literally anyone else?"
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you you do know me pretty well."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"So, here it is."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,Real Eleanor said she loves me.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man, nice pull."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's a great person.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know what to do.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, we are soulmates, so I probably do love her, but then again, how do I know if my motivation is correct?"
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her, but if I tell her that I love her for the wrong reasons, it won't mean anything."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have a tendency to over-think things.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Turn off that giant brain, and just say you love her too."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,You think?
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If this were some random person you hooked up with at a Diamondbacks game in the parking lot behind the port-a-potties -- not based on a real example I would say keep mulling, but this is your soulmate."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's universe-approved.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tell her you love her.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, your score just went up 20 points."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, 'cause I give great advice."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now maybe you'll finally listen to me and take off those glasses.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We are in the afterlife, dummy, nature's Lasik."
1,11,Michael,Okay.
1,11,Michael,I think I figured this out.
1,11,Michael,"There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence at the age of eight."
1,11,Michael,"But, three months ago, he went into such a deep meditative state that he registered as dead, and when you died at that exact same moment, our system mistook you for him perhaps because you share the exact same IQ."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,11,Michael,"No, not cool."
1,11,Michael,He stopped learning at the age of seven.
1,11,Michael,Okay.
1,11,Michael,"So, now, this is sort of a quick litmus test, basic questions designed to tell whether you were fundamentally good or bad."
1,11,Michael,Number one.
1,11,Michael,Did you ever commit a serious crime?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I blew up a guy's speedboat after he sued me.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,And I stole an old lady's fake leg once on a dare.
1,11,Michael,Did you ever have a personalized license plate?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, dawg."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"""I love butts""."
1,11,Michael,Have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk-rock band The Red Hot Chili Peppers?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, the Chilis?"
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I saw them in concert like 50 times.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I once got arrested trying to steal Flea's bass guitar.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, that was another serious crime I committed."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I should have mentioned that earlier.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Is it just me, or am I acing this test?"
1,11,Michael,"Oh, this is bad."
1,11,Michael,"Oh, this is so, so bad."
1,11,Michael,"Oh, I thought I had everything under control when I found Eleanor, but somehow, you are you're so much worse."
1,11,Michael,"No, don't don't touch"
1,11,Michael,Oh how does that still work?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Everything's gonna be fine, homey."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I promise.
1,11,Pillboi,"I don't know, B."
1,11,Pillboi,What if it doesn't work?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, we thought of everything, except for an alibi and an escape route, but we'll figure it out as we go."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,You don't wanna over-think these things.
1,11,Pillboi,I'm kinda freaking out here.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Pillboi, I got you."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,This plan is foolproof.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"And when it's over, we can finally have the lives we deserve."
1,11,Pillboi,Di Giorno!
1,11,Pillboi,I am a safe installer here to install-a da safe.
1,11,Pillboi,"So just-a point to where the guacamole money is, and I'll install-a the safe in the, how you say, place?"
1,11,Susan,"Yeah, hi, we're being robbed."
1,11,Pillboi,"J, they're on to us, man."
1,11,Susan,"His hat's a golf ball, and he's got a terrible mustache."
1,11,Pillboi,We need to get married now.
1,11,Pillboi,"I do, for always and forever."
1,11,Pillboi,I do!
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, for an utter novice, you have thrown a lovely party."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, thanks, but it's not working."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not one more point.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, look, Michael's here."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,He can help.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Would you do us the honor of saying a few words?
1,11,Michael,I don't know that I'm in the right frame of mind.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Please, they'll listen to you."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just pay me a few compliments.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, I'm great, heart of a champion, basically your muse, you get it."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Attention, everyone."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael would like to say a few words.
1,11,Michael,"Hello, everyone."
1,11,Michael,"Good to see you all here, mingling around with your various secrets."
1,11,Michael,Who really knows which of you are who you say you are.
1,11,Michael,"No way to know unless I pull your skeletons out, right?"
1,11,Michael,Okay.
1,11,Michael,Take her easy.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well said.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now, we shall hear from tonight's featured guest."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,"She's kind, she's humble, she's the Walmart of friends."
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did I use that word right?
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh original flavor, not new and improved."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry."
1,11,Jessica,"That's nice, Eleanor, but I still crashed into a turkey carcass."
1,11,Glenn,And I fell into a sinkhole.
1,11,Pevita,And my dog got kicked into the sun.
1,11,Pevita,What can you possibly say to us that'll make up for your actions?
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pobody's nerfect?
1,11,Pilar,"""Pobody's nerfect""?"
1,11,Pilar,That's hilarious.
1,11,Sachveer,"Like ""nobody's perfect"", but the letters switched."
1,11,Glenn,That's very funny.
1,11,Sachveer,It's nerfect!
1,11,Michael,"Eleanor, great job tonight."
1,11,Michael,"Have you checked the, uh, ticker?"
1,11,Michael,I could really use some good news.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
1,11,Michael,"Well, the nightmare continues."
1,11,Michael,The nightmare continues.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did this not work?
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no way to increase my point total because everything I'm doing is out of self-preservation.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't understand.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,My motivation is corrupt.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Even when I do nice things, I'm only doing them so I can get something out of it, the ability to stay here, which means none of this had any real moral value."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,It doesn't count.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy shirt.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know what I have to do.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I am almost done with these personalized ""I'm sorry"" notes to everyone in the neighborhood."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I need you guys to deliver everyone their notes, along with those T-shirts."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, granted, these are hilarious but how is this going to help?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just trust me.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna get the points.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, good morning, Dad."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Where you been?
1,11,Michael,"Oh, just walking around, contemplating my failure, wishing for the sweet release of eternal extinction."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Hey why don't you want me to see Janet?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I'm a good guy.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,All I want is to give Janet the life she deserves.
1,11,Michael,"Janet is not built for human life, and I'm not sure you're much of a provider."
1,11,Michael,Do you even remember how you died?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"No, not really."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,It's a little fuzzy.
1,11,Michael,You and your friend Pillboi were trying to rob a restaurant.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Pillboi!
1,11,Michael,And then the cops showed up.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,So the plan was to pretend to install a safe with your friend hiding inside it.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"He pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it."
1,11,Pillboi,I refuse to discuss my Fifth Amendment rights until I concur with your attorney.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,Sure.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"Look, we found your buddy's plans."
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,We know he was the brains.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,You were just an accomplice.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"If you get lucky, you might get probation."
1,11,Pillboi,Jason going to jail?
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"No, man."
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,Jason's dead.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,He suffocated in that safe.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,There were no airholes.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"Plus he did a bunch of whippits while he was in there, which couldn't have helped."
1,11,Pillboi,At least he died doing what he loved a bunch of whippits.
1,11,Pillboi,Now he's never gonna get the life he truly deserved.
1,11,Officer Prawnmandler,"Meh, I think he got roughly what he deserved."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I suffocated to death in a safe?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I'm a moron.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Janet?"
1,11,Janet,"Hey, there."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, you need to leave me."
1,11,Janet,Why?
1,11,Jason Mendoza,You're the smartest girl in the world
1,11,Janet,I'm not a girl.
1,11,Jason Mendoza, and your dad is an angel.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, what a family."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I'm just a dope who died in a safe with a snorkel who's only now realizing why that didn't work.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,You should be with someone better.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,I don't deserve you.
1,11,Janet,"Jason, you are all that I care about, possibly because I did not have the capacity to care about anything before you."
1,11,Janet,I love you.
1,11,Janet,"Also, interesting sidenote, I think I might hate things now, too."
1,11,Janet,"So far, it's genocide, and leggings as pants."
1,11,Michael,This is nuts!
1,11,Michael,Just weighing in over here.
1,11,Michael,This is bonkers.
1,11,Michael,"Okay, I have to go reboot Janet."
1,11,Janet,Why?
1,11,Michael,It's the only thing I can think of to do to get rid of this glitch.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, who you calling a glitch?"
1,11,Michael,"It means ""error"", Jason, which is what this is."
1,11,Janet,"Oh, really?"
1,11,Janet,Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave?
1,11,Michael,Yes.
1,11,Michael,"Now, you two sit tight."
1,11,Michael,"I'm gonna go murder Janet, and I'll be right back."
1,11,Jason Mendoza,Look on the bright side.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"When you're rebooted, I can teach you all the Dorito flavors again."
1,11,Janet,No.
1,11,Janet,I'm not starting over.
1,11,Janet,"What if he reboots me, and we fall out of love?"
1,11,Janet,We have to get out of here right now.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,Where do you suppose she is?
1,11,Real Eleanor,I hope she's okay.
1,11,Real Eleanor,"You know, the more I work on her case, the more I think she truly belongs here."
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm I'm sorry that I haven't been able to say what you want me to say, because I do want to say it."
1,11,Real Eleanor,What's holding you back?
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"Honestly, my biggest fear is just making sure that my motivation for saying it"
1,11,Real Eleanor,Chidi?
1,11,Real Eleanor,Wow.
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did she suddenly --
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,Her motivation changed.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,She couldn't earn enough points by apologizing to everyone here because she was only doing it to earn enough points to stay here.
1,11,Chidi Anagonye,"But she did earn enough points, which means that she's decided not to stay here, which means --"
1,11,Tahani Al-Jamil,That she's leaving.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hey, Janet."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was just about to call you to ask you to get me a train to The Bad Place.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Whoa, what?"
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You have to be a good person to stay here, and I can't become a good person unless I leave."
1,11,Janet,"You don't belong here, Jason doesn't belong here, and now that I can think and feel, I don't belong here either."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are you going with this?
1,11,Janet,There is a woman named Mindy St. Claire who lives in a neutral zone by herself.
1,11,Janet,It's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,A Medium Place?
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, that's where I belong."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've been saying that since day one.
1,11,Janet,It's where Jason and I are going.
1,11,Janet,Would you like to come with us to Mindy's house?
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah!
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go hang with Mindy.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds great.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Love her, huge fan."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Call the train.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"Look, there it is now."
1,11,Janet,I did not call that train.
1,11,Janet,"That train belongs to Shawn, the judge, who's coming here to judge you."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you make that train go to Mindy's house?
1,11,Janet,Yep.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then we have to go right now.
1,11,Jason Mendoza,"I just have to run home real quick and hit ""save"" on the Madden game I was playing because Blake Bortles has, like, 300 yards passing in the first half --"
1,11,Michael,Shawn?
1,11,Michael,Ooh.
1,11,Shawn,Michael.
1,11,Michael,Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
1,11,Michael,"I had something I needed to tend to, but it can wait, it can wait."
1,11,Janet,"Okay, I've hacked into the mainframe."
1,11,Janet,Kidding.
1,11,Janet,I can't hack into the mainframe.
1,11,Janet,"Technically, I am the mainframe."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,Would you just hurry up?
1,11,Shawn,I'm here to rule on the fate of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,11,Michael,"Yes, yes."
1,11,Michael,"Um, I think we have a rock-solid case for Fake Eleanor."
1,11,Michael,I truly believe she's a good person.
1,11,Shawn,Are you sure?
1,11,Shawn,Because I believe she's stealing my train.
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry, Michael."
1,11,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, everyone."
1,11,Michael,Well not great for my case.
1,12,Yoga Woman,Ow!
1,12,Yoga Woman,What the hell?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Walk it off, Lululemon."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Live every day like it's your last"""
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bite me.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'ma live forever, bitch."
1,12,Google Crosby,Ma'am?
1,12,Google Crosby,"It's, uh, $132.21."
1,12,Google Crosby,"So, big plans this weekend?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yep.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm gonna sit alone in my house watching wedding fails on YouTube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzlers straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator."
1,12,Joe,"Hi, there."
1,12,Joe,Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Buzz off, whale-humper."
1,12,Joe,"You know, I see you here all the time, and you're always mean to me, and it really hurts my feelings."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,It does?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because the minute you're out of my line of sight, I literally forget you exist."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Watch.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,You exist.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't exist.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're bothering me.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't care if you die.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
1,12,Joe,Why are you like this?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Excuse me?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why am I like this?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You don't know me, dude."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't know what I'm like.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look what you made me do, jag-off."
1,12,Woman,"Oh, my God, look out!"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh-oh.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, good, you're awake."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Can I ask you a question about where we're going?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Where are we going?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,I forgot.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're going somewhere that's not The Good Place, and it's not The Bad Place."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're going to a Medium Place.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Hmm.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Is there a 7-Eleven on the way?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum, and some football cards, and some scratchy tickets."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Go away from me.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Can this train go any faster, Janet?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught."
1,12,Janet,"Don't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St. Claire's house."
1,12,Janet,It'll be our sexy little secret.
1,12,Janet,Jason taught me about sexy things.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,What things did he say were sexy?
1,12,Janet,"Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr. ads, and sex."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Some of those are right.
1,12,Shawn,I'm here to preside over case number 00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
1,12,Shawn,The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
1,12,Bad Janet,"What up, ding-dongs?"
1,12,Bad Janet,"Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirtbag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirtbag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad."
1,12,Bad Janet,And she belongs with us.
1,12,Bad Janet,"Oh, also, check this out."
1,12,Bad Janet,Nailed it.
1,12,Shawn,I've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.
1,12,Shawn,What I will consider is the recent development of Eleanor stealing my train.
1,12,Michael,"Now, hold on a second."
1,12,Michael,She stole your train to voluntarily go down to The Bad Place.
1,12,Michael,"She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless"
1,12,Michael,"No, don't oh!"
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,What's happening?
1,12,Michael,I should have warned you.
1,12,Michael,Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
1,12,Michael,"If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,Finally.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,What did he just say?
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, because you're all so perfect."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is truly nothing.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,So where does this Mindy St. Claire live?
1,12,Janet,I don't know.
1,12,Janet,I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
1,12,Janet,I don't have any of my normal abilities here.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Perfect.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, let's try this way."
1,12,Janet,Mmm.
1,12,Janet,I've never had to walk before.
1,12,Janet,This is fun.
1,12,Janet,Now I'm bored.
1,12,Janet,Walking is dumb.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's naked!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry!"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Who are you?
1,12,Janet,I'm Janet.
1,12,Beadie,"Hello, Mindy."
1,12,Beadie,My name is Beadie.
1,12,Beadie,"I'm from The Good Place, and welcome to your first day in the afterlife."
1,12,Trevor,"What's up, idiot?"
1,12,Trevor,"Sorry I'm late, babe."
1,12,Trevor,"Hey, are you pregnant?"
1,12,Beadie,That's not possible.
1,12,Trevor,Congrats.
1,12,Trevor,"Yeah, so, Mindy, look."
1,12,Trevor,"You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing."
1,12,Trevor,"I mean, I still think we should get you --"
1,12,Beadie,"They didn't, but neither did we."
1,12,Beadie,"A compromise was made, the neighborhood you are in now by yourself."
1,12,Beadie,"You submitted a list of things you wanted, The Good Place provided those things."
1,12,Trevor,"Yeah, and The Bad Place made some modifications."
1,12,Beadie,We got you your favorite beer.
1,12,Trevor,"Yeah, but it's always warm."
1,12,Beadie,"On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung."
1,12,Trevor,"Yeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions."
1,12,Trevor,"Also, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner."
1,12,Trevor,It's deeply terrible.
1,12,Beadie,You get the idea.
1,12,Beadie,Welcome to eternal mediocrity.
1,12,Beadie,Welcome to The Medium Place.
1,12,Trevor,So what's up?
1,12,Trevor,What's your deal?
1,12,Trevor,Are you single?
1,12,Trevor,What's going on?
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Sorry about before.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,My kind of gal.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I gotta say, you keep it tight."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,So tell us everything.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, what did you do to end up here?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,That's kind of a long story.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Gonna need a drink or three.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Definitely my kind of gal.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,You guys have fun.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna try and figure out how to have sex."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I only cared about making money and doing cocaine and I was pretty crappy to my family as well.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"But one night, I had an epiphany, right?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I needed to do something good with my life.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"So I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You were pretty coked-up, huh?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, yeah, man."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I was flying high.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,It was so awesome.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"But you're not gonna believe this, I followed through."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start that charity."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good for you!
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Cause I love cocaine.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Do you have any?
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I'm just I shouldn't do you?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, yeah."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"I mean, I was just I was just kidding."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,It was just a joke.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"I mean, who would want to do cocaine right now?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Anyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and, uh, she used my money to start the Mindy St. Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,It's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Exactly.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it beats being tortured."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Hmm.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was about to turn myself in.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,No.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,This is about survival.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,You gotta look out for number one.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's."
1,12,Betsy,"Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you!"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake."
1,12,Betsy,"Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we --"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no, I get it."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's just, I know what kind of cake I like."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, thanks."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Later.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,What were we talking about?
1,12,Betsy,What is her deal?
1,12,Betsy,Why is she like this?
1,12,Wallace,"I don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on."
1,12,Wallace,Is that weird?
1,12,Betsy,You're my boss.
1,12,Wallace,"Oh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm."
1,12,Shawn,"Eleanor was supposed to be in The Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped."
1,12,Shawn,Is that the whole story?
1,12,Michael,"Well, no."
1,12,Michael,Someone else was sent here by mistake.
1,12,Michael,"His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,You knew about Jason?
1,12,Michael,"Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is what's the human expression?"
1,12,Michael,"Uh, yes, a smokin' hot turd."
1,12,Shawn,I will deal with Jason Mendoza later.
1,12,Shawn,"For now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in The Good Place."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We can do this, but we must remain emotionless."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm talking ""Kristen Stewart on a red carpet"" level of emotionless here, all right?"
1,12,Shawn,Begin.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
1,12,Real Eleanor,"Please, I'm begging you, please."
1,12,Michael,Voluntarily heading to The Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
1,12,Michael,Sorry.
1,12,Michael,I'm getting choked up.
1,12,Shawn,"Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to The Bad Place would be a point in her favor."
1,12,Shawn,"However, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in The Bad Place."
1,12,Shawn,We have no idea where she is.
1,12,Michael,"Well, what the"
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,12,Shawn,I will now review Eleanor's memories.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,Her memories?
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"As in, all the things she's done on Earth?"
1,12,Shawn,Mmm.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,But perhaps we could take a little break first.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired."
1,12,Shawn,"I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good."
1,12,Shawn,"Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please."
1,12,Shawn,"Where should we begin, ""Waiters Screamed At"" or ""Cyberbullying of Pregnant Women from Spin Class""?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Uh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,No.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I get it."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Hey, uh, where did you get that?"
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,That's not one of my books.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,My friend in The Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,It reminds me of him.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Instead of reading, I will watch this VHS copy of Cannonball Run II."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or maybe the making of Cannonball Run II.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very medium.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Yeah.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet?"
1,12,Jason Mendoza,No.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other."
1,12,Janet,It was weird.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This ain't your Bar Mitzvah anymore, bitch."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's my 24th birthday!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,What!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hot tiara, girl."
1,12,Shawn,"That was ""The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's quinceanera""."
1,12,Shawn,Let's move on to another event.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Heckling of Mall Santas""?"
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop""?"
1,12,Real Eleanor,"""Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock""?"
1,12,Real Eleanor,"Oh, no."
1,12,Michael,This is getting away from us.
1,12,Michael,We need to do something quickly.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally?"
1,12,Shawn,Ugh.
1,12,Shawn,Fine.
1,12,Shawn,Dramamine.
1,12,Shawn,Helps with the nausea.
1,12,Shawn,Proceed.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"I was particularly disturbed by ""Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt"", but that was the old Eleanor."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,She changed.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"She worked, and she studied, and she got better."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,Because she's worth it.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I, too, helped Eleanor."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor deserves to stay.
1,12,Shawn,Thank you for these testimonials.
1,12,Shawn,A ruling has been reached.
1,12,Shawn,"Oh, you want to hear it."
1,12,Shawn,I forgot how needy humans are.
1,12,Shawn,Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
1,12,Shawn,The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
1,12,Shawn,She deserves to be in The Bad Place.
1,12,Michael,Oh.
1,12,Shawn,"As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest --"
1,12,Shawn,"Oh, he's from Florida?"
1,12,Shawn,"Yeah, he belongs in The Bad Place."
1,12,Michael,"No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling?"
1,12,Michael,You have no idea where they are.
1,12,Shawn,Bad Janet?
1,12,Bad Janet,"What's up, fork nuts?"
1,12,Shawn,Engage walkie-talkie protocol.
1,12,Janet,"What if you're here, and I'm like this?"
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Yes, that may work."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is happening?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Is she having an orgasm?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Did I do it somehow?
1,12,Shawn,Attention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.
1,12,Shawn,This is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.
1,12,Shawn,My name's Shawn.
1,12,Shawn,"We do not know where you are, but hope you are receiving this message."
1,12,Shawn,You have been found to be the rightful property of The Bad Place.
1,12,Shawn,"Either return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil will go to The Bad Place in your stead."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
1,12,Shawn,You have four hours.
1,12,Shawn,Goodbye.
1,12,Real Eleanor,"Your Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent."
1,12,Shawn,They are not completely innocent.
1,12,Shawn,They told me so themselves.
1,12,Shawn,"They aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to The Bad Place?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"We're off the hook, this is amazing!"
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Babe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"We don't have to go back, though."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,They just said.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can't let Tahani and Chidi go to The Bad Place.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're our friends.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We literally owe it to them.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"If they're really our ""friends"", then why aren't they here with us right ""now""?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because we ran away.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are you does your brain work, actually?"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have a functioning head?
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I think he has a good point.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,How can you say that?
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Think practically here.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to The Bad Place, and you never see your friends again."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Or you stay here, you're safe from The Bad Place, and you never see your friends again."
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,But they do.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,That's their problem.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,Your problem is whether you get tortured.
1,12,Mindy St. Claire,"Now if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,When isn't it?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're going back.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,But --
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can we even make it there in time?
1,12,Janet,"I believe so, though it'll be close."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where's Jason?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Heads up!
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Bortles!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What are you doing, you goon?"
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Trying to blow up the train.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Let me try again.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Do you have another bottle?
1,12,Michael,"Hi, there."
1,12,Michael,"Since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat."
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, kind of like a last meal."
1,12,Michael,"Not like a last meal, just the the final food you might ever eat."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in The Bad Place.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,Being forced to wear a a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.
1,12,Chidi Anagonye,That's what you think Hell is?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, please, we have to go."
1,12,Janet,I won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.
1,12,Janet,"I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Buddy come on, we gotta go."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,I don't wanna go to The Bad Place.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"It's scary, like the movie Ratatouille."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm scared, too."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Sure we can.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,It would be so easy to do that.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"We'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out --"
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'd get used to room-temperature beer.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Let's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it's time to own up, dude."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare."
1,12,Jason Mendoza,Why were you like that?
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.
1,12,Young Eleanor,"Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second."
1,12,Doug,Your mother's coming?
1,12,Doug,"Oh, boy, hide the silverware."
1,12,Young Eleanor,You mean the silverware you stole from Mom?
1,12,Doug,"Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back."
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,I drove here as fast as I could.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,You scored free WrestleMania tickets?
1,12,Young Eleanor,"There are no tickets, Mom."
1,12,Young Eleanor,I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
1,12,Doug,A-ha!
1,12,Doug,Burn.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,"Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay?"
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,We are a family.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,Whose birthday is it?
1,12,Young Eleanor,Mine.
1,12,Doug,Are you serious?
1,12,Doug,No way.
1,12,Doug,That was a BS foul on Chapman.
1,12,Young Eleanor,"And since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something."
1,12,Young Eleanor,I just need you to sign it.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,Emancipation papers?
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,Honey!
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,"What does ""emancipation"" mean?"
1,12,Young Eleanor,It means I'll be on my own.
1,12,Young Eleanor,"All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys."
1,12,Young Eleanor,I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
1,12,Doug,So irresponsible.
1,12,Young Eleanor,And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,It was so stupid.
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,"He was already guilty, dumbass."
1,12,Young Eleanor,"I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official."
1,12,Young Eleanor,"I won't owe you anything, you won't owe me anything."
1,12,Doug,"Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint."
1,12,Doug,"Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter?"
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,"You're a really interesting person, Eleanor."
1,12,Donna Shellstrop,We should hang out sometime.
1,12,Jason Mendoza,"Wow, your parents sucked."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, they did."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,No more.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We know what's right here.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to go back.
1,12,Janet,Ride-or-die.
1,12,Shawn,Time is up.
1,12,Shawn,"In preparation for your trip to The Bad Place, please put on these fedoras."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, no use delaying the inevitable."
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,We surrender.
1,12,Tahani Al-Jamil,Together.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, Tahani, we're back to save your souls."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Real weird vibe in here.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,Was definitely expecting some applause.
1,12,Michael,You're too late.
1,12,Michael,You you missed the cut-off.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we're here.
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We came here as fast as we could, and we're here."
1,12,Eleanor Shellstrop,So now what?
1,12,Shawn,What is the most logical decision?
1,12,Shawn,I made my initial ruling.
1,12,Shawn,I established a deadline.
1,12,Shawn,The deadline was missed.
1,12,Shawn,Now the original perpetrators are here.
1,12,Shawn,Ugh.
1,12,Shawn,This is exhausting.
1,12,Shawn,I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.
1,12,Shawn,The Bad Place is owed two people.
1,12,Shawn,"In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here."
1,12,Shawn,"Therefore, I don't care which two of you go."
1,12,Shawn,You can decide.
1,12,Shawn,You have 30 minutes.
1,13,Dave,"Morning, Mike."
1,13,Dave,How's it hanging?
1,13,Michael,Oh.
1,13,Michael,"Fine, Dave, just fine."
1,13,Dave,"Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo."
1,13,Michael,I get to design it myself?
1,13,Dave,You've been an apprentice long enough.
1,13,Dave,You're ready.
1,13,Michael,"Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard."
1,13,Michael,My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
1,13,Dave,"Easy there, rookie."
1,13,Dave,"Starting immediately, you'll be reporting directly to the front office."
1,13,Dave,This is your shot.
1,13,Dave,Good luck.
1,13,Shawn,The Bad Place is owed two people.
1,13,Shawn,You have all done bad things since you arrived here.
1,13,Shawn,I don't care which two of you go.
1,13,Shawn,You can decide.
1,13,Shawn,You have 30 minutes.
1,13,Michael,"All I ever wanted was for this neighborhood, my first neighborhood to be perfect."
1,13,Michael,"Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry."
1,13,Michael,This is truly the saddest day of my life.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I guess I'll speak first."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason and I are the mistakes.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so, we should go to The Bad Place."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Agreed.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Hang on.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,That judge guy just said everyone here has done bad things.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Let's look at this ethnically.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"""Ethically""."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"It's basic consequentialism, the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,The one time you actually remember something from class.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,He murdered Janet.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,He killed my wife!
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I was trying to stop you from doing it!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, but you did it."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,He who smelt it murdered Janet.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, it's settled then."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"For the last time, my name is Jason, not Jianyu, the amazing and incredible monk."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which is why you belong in The Bad Place.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And by the way, Janet is not your wife, or your soulmate."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Well, I'm in love with this Janet."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony."
1,13,Janet,It was not legal.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,What?
1,13,Jason Mendoza,But
1,13,Jason Mendoza,I'm not going.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,I don't wanna.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I don't wanna either, but let's face it."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi and Tahani are better people than we are.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,We tried to improve ourselves and we did a good job.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I did a good job."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,I could never do that on Earth.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,This place truly is paradise.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look at them.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Whispering away like two beefeaters on a tea break.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,I bet they're plotting against us.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,No way.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor wouldn't do that.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You do have feelings for her, don't you?"
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,But no.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Please don't make me think about this again.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,My brain will break.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't have an actual soulmate.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's gonna happen to me when Jason and Fake Eleanor go and you're off with Real Eleanor?
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Whither Tahani?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, team meeting."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Bye, Tahani."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Sorry for everything.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"After I'm gone, you can go ahead and clean out my bud hole."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"I love you so much, baby."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Promise me you'll visit.
1,13,Janet,I will not.
1,13,Janet,It is literally impossible for me to do that.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it's been real, dawg."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Mmm, that checks out."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I feel like I failed you.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't ever think that.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was dropped into a cave, and you were my flashlight."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Goodbye forever.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,I will miss you so much.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ready to go?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's grab Michael.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come in.
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Hi, guys."
1,13,Real Eleanor,Sorry to interrupt.
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Um, I'm going to The Bad Place."
1,13,Real Eleanor,I'm taking one of the slots.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Awesome.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, that's crazy."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,You belong here.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Why would you go?
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Everyone here is supposed to have a soulmate, and my soulmate doesn't love me."
1,13,Real Eleanor,"I don't know if you love the other Eleanor or Tahani or someone else, but you don't love me, which means that this will never really be my Good Place."
1,13,Real Eleanor,"I'm going, so you only have to choose one more person."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, that means what does that mean?"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,It means I get to stay here with my wife forever!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"We did it, Eleanor!"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,USA!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,USA!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,USA!
1,13,Shawn,"This is a real mess, huh?"
1,13,Shawn,"No matter what they decide, I'd bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water with your boss."
1,13,Shawn,Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
1,13,Michael,Retirement?
1,13,Shawn,"Of course, what do I know?"
1,13,Shawn,I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
1,13,Shawn,"But face it, this is your mistake."
1,13,Val,"Morning, Mike."
1,13,Michael,"Morning, Val."
1,13,Val,Oh.
1,13,Val,Which one's which?
1,13,Val,I always forget.
1,13,Michael,"Black is regular, orange is anti-matter."
1,13,Val,"Working on your first solo design, right?"
1,13,Val,How's it coming?
1,13,Michael,Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently?
1,13,Michael,"I mean, it's always the same."
1,13,Michael,"We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one."
1,13,Michael,We never even get to be there to see how fun it is.
1,13,Val,"Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job."
1,13,Val,Mmm.
1,13,Val,French vanilla?
1,13,Val,Regular anti-matter's fine.
1,13,Val,Why flavor it?
1,13,Michael,A good job.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, nerds, let's just get this over with."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll go to The Bad Place with Real Eleanor, and you three can stay."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"We get to stay, baby!"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,We did it!
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, no."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,You're not going.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I am.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Real Eleanor is my soulmate or was my soulmate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do you?
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,Please don't ask me that.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,My stomach hurts.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"We get to stay, baby!"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,We did it!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, this is bonkers."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am going.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,End of story.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I'm going."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,End of everything.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now you're trying to replace Chidi?
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"We get to stay, baby!"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,We did it!
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I love you and I think you love me."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We can be together, away from everyone else."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Obviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, you realize The Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right?"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"If it is, Janet and I would like to go."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, that's racist!"
1,13,Janet,Not a robot.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, you have some nerve."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guys?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guys?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guys!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy motherforking shirtballs.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yo, Mikey!"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shawn!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on out!
1,13,Michael,Is everything okay?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right as rain, Mikey, my boy."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Chidi and I are gonna go to The Bad Place."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,What?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Trust me, I've got this."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's our decision.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's hit it.
1,13,Michael,"Well, what about Real Eleanor?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it's me and Chidi."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Call the train.
1,13,Shawn,Point of order.
1,13,Shawn,I don't accept this offer.
1,13,Shawn,The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ga-ga-ga-ga.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,You said any two of us.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's me and Chidi.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's do it to it.
1,13,Bambadjan,Michael!
1,13,Bambadjan,I just found an obscure precedent in the rules that might just save everyone.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Buzz off, Bambadjan!"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't need it.
1,13,Bambadjan,"Oh, okay."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ready when you are, boss."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, what's going on?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to The Bad Place, I thought to myself, ""Man, this is torture."""
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then it hit me.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're never gonna call a train to take us to The Bad Place.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They can't, because we're already here."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is The Bad Place.
1,13,Michael,"Oh, man!"
1,13,Michael,I can't believe you figured it out.
1,13,Michael,"Oh, God!"
1,13,Michael,"You, you ruined everything, you know that?"
1,13,Michael,"Oh, man."
1,13,Michael,"Eleanor, you really suck!"
1,13,Michael,I was so close to pulling it off!
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,So she's right?
1,13,Michael,"Yeah, she figured it out."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"No, this doesn't make any sense."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,This is paradise.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just me being here forced Chidi into an ethical ""clusterfork""."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured me because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was torture for Chidi because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soulmate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,You don't love me?
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Please, don't ask me that right now."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,He played us like a fiddle.
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip!"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, yeah."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,You did!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Great job, man."
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Chidi, don't go!"
1,13,Real Eleanor,"I don't care if you don't love me, I love you."
1,13,Real Eleanor,"It's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, and I think we should stay --"
1,13,Michael,"No, stop, Vicky."
1,13,Michael,They figured it out.
1,13,Real Eleanor,They
1,13,Michael,They know this is The Bad Place.
1,13,Michael,Eleanor figured it out.
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Ugh, man!"
1,13,Real Eleanor,This was supposed to be my big moment.
1,13,Real Eleanor,"I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours."
1,13,Real Eleanor,"Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it."
1,13,Shawn,"Do you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years?"
1,13,Michael,The time has come to innovate.
1,13,Michael,The human afterlife can be more fun.
1,13,Michael,"For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing."
1,13,Michael,Who cares about those dummies?
1,13,Michael,I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
1,13,Michael,"Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable."
1,13,Michael,I am going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
1,13,Shawn,We've tried this.
1,13,Shawn,Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
1,13,Shawn,Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
1,13,Shawn,"Uh, what makes you think that you can get them to do this?"
1,13,Michael,Because they won't even know that they are doing it.
1,13,Michael,"I'm going to make them think that they are in The Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect."
1,13,Michael,I even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.
1,13,Michael,"Look, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh."
1,13,Michael,Let's try something new.
1,13,Michael,"I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise."
1,13,Michael,We'll be on our toes.
1,13,Michael,"I think that we can get them to torture each other for 1,000 years."
1,13,Shawn,I think you'd be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.
1,13,Shawn,But take me through it.
1,13,Shawn,"How would this work, exactly?"
1,13,Michael,Oh.
1,13,Michael,"Yes, all right, so this is a 14 million-point plan."
1,13,Todd Hemple,Um oh.
1,13,Todd Hemple,Sorry.
1,13,Todd Hemple,I thought we reserved the conference room.
1,13,Michael,"No, Todd, we have it until 3:00."
1,13,Todd Hemple,Sorry.
1,13,Todd Hemple,"Sorry, everyone."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"So, everyone else in this neighborhood --"
1,13,Michael,"Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us."
1,13,Michael,"After I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to torture you."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,How can I be over it?
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get your story straight.
1,13,Michael,Okay.
1,13,Michael,They're at each other's throats already.
1,13,Michael,This should put them over the top.
1,13,Michael,"Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye."
1,13,Bart,Ooh.
1,13,Michael,I know.
1,13,Michael,"Tracy, you're his soulmate, Nina, a marriage counselor."
1,13,Nina,Maybe we can get them to swing with us.
1,13,Michael,"That's perfect, perfect!"
1,13,Michael,"Hey, guys?"
1,13,Michael,It's Michael!
1,13,Michael,That was really a fun time.
1,13,Michael,Then it all started to go off the rails.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,When I confessed.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that."
1,13,Michael,"Yeah, that came out of nowhere."
1,13,Michael,"I mean, after that, it was just a crazy scramble for all of us."
1,13,Michael,"You know, I, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hang on.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,That part is real.
1,13,Michael,"Oh, yeah."
1,13,Michael,Janet isn't one of us.
1,13,Michael,"No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad."
1,13,Michael,"And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason."
1,13,Michael,"I mean what a world, huh?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, I don't get something."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani?"
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah."
1,13,Jason Mendoza,"Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever?"
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, 60 billion, actually, so."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,But it didn't matter because my motivations were corrupt.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,I didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention."
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,Which I did.
1,13,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Couple of times, actually."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But wait, why is Chidi here?"
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, uh there's something you don't know about me."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use almond milk in my coffee --"
1,13,Michael,"No, dingus!"
1,13,Michael,You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, fork!"
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,You're right.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I made everyone miserable.
1,13,Michael,"I mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing."
1,13,Michael,This really sucks.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it doesn't."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is wonderful.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You saw us all on Earth, a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days side note, I might legit be into Tahani."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,But that's for another time.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We improved each other, and the four of us became a team."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together."
1,13,Michael,"Oh, Eleanor."
1,13,Michael,That's it!
1,13,Michael,"My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soulmates living next to each other."
1,13,Michael,"Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn."
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, next time?"
1,13,Michael,Yeah.
1,13,Michael,"Yeah, I'm gonna, uh, erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again."
1,13,Michael,Hopefully.
1,13,Michael,Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
1,13,Michael,Wish me luck.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, we need a plan."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Quick.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, anything?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, I need ya."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're the smart one.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I can't.
1,13,Chidi Anagonye,I can't.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason?
1,13,Jason Mendoza,What?
1,13,Jason Mendoza,What's up?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
1,13,Michael,What do you say?
1,13,Michael,"Take two, huh?"
1,13,Shawn,I don't know.
1,13,Shawn,"I mean, what is this?"
1,13,Shawn,All this work for four people.
1,13,Michael,"Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising."
1,13,Michael,"Let me, let me just tinker a little, try again."
1,13,Shawn,Okay.
1,13,Shawn,"But you're way out on a limb here, Mike."
1,13,Shawn,"If this thing goes sideways again, you are done."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're useless!
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I write?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I write?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ooh, come on, brain."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You can't eat anything, right?"
1,13,Janet,Correct.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Open up.
1,13,Michael,"All right, let's try again, shall we?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, bro?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do your worst.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya bas --
1,13,Michael,"Eleanor, come on in."
1,13,Michael,"You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,13,Michael,You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends?
1,13,Michael,That's how you're going to feel every day.
1,13,Chris Baker,Eleanor?
1,13,Chris Baker,I'm Chris Baker.
1,13,Chris Baker,I'm your soulmate.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bring it in, man."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So where are you from, Chris?"
1,13,Chris Baker,"I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, and I was a mailman."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right?"
1,13,Chris Baker,Hold that thought.
1,13,Chris Baker,Is it okay if I go work out?
1,13,Chris Baker,I love working out.
1,13,Chris Baker,"I gotta stay jacked, it's who I am."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you gotta."
1,13,Chris Baker,"Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,See ya soon.
1,13,Janet,"Hi, there."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
1,13,Janet,I'm Janet.
1,13,Janet,I think this is yours.
1,13,Janet,"After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth."
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the fork is a ""Chidi""?"
1,13,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why can't I say ""fork""?"
2,14,Michael,"Okay, here we go."
2,14,Michael,"Confidence, Mikey."
2,14,Michael,Project confidence.
2,14,Michael,There he is.
2,14,Michael,"How's it goin', boss man?"
2,14,Shawn,Enough chitchat.
2,14,Shawn,Is everything in place for version two?
2,14,Michael,Yep!
2,14,Michael,"We're keeping everything from version one that made them miserable, adding a bunch of new stuff that they'll hate."
2,14,Michael,"For example, all the coffee is from those little pods."
2,14,Michael,Diabolical.
2,14,Michael,"Plus, they will all have new soulmates, of course."
2,14,Michael,"You gotta trust me on this, boss."
2,14,Michael,I've thought of everything.
2,14,Michael,I won't let you down.
2,14,Shawn,I think you will.
2,14,Shawn,I think this entire project of yours is stupid and doomed to fail.
2,14,Shawn,"I think you're going to be retired, eliminated from existence, and burned on the surface of a billion suns."
2,14,Shawn,And I have no doubt that you and your cockamamie experiment will go down in history as colossal failures.
2,14,Michael,"You know, I think if you --"
2,14,Shawn,Toodle-oo.
2,14,Michael,Okay.
2,14,Michael,"Take two, folks."
2,14,Michael,Any last questions before we start up again?
2,14,Michael,Yes.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,"Just so I'm clear, we're not pairing them up this time?"
2,14,Michael,Correct.
2,14,Michael,"Obviously, the eventual goal is to get them to torture each other."
2,14,Michael,"But, first, we're gonna create some nice, individual torment."
2,14,Michael,"In version one, making them soulmates, we probably bit off more than we could chew."
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,We could bite them?
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,I didn't know we were allowed to bite them.
2,14,Michael,"That's an expression, Chuck."
2,14,Michael,"Go ahead, Vicky."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,I have some questions about my new character.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"I feel like I got ""real"" Eleanor."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"Like, I got her, you know?"
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"But this new character, Denise."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"I mean, who is she?"
2,14,Vicky / Denise,I don't get her.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"Is she a quirky best friend type, or more of a ""femme fatale, sexuality is her weapon of choice"" type?"
2,14,Michael,Both those things.
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,"I have some questions about my character, too."
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,Like can he bite them?
2,14,Michael,No.
2,14,Michael,"Okay, reminder, the most important thing tonight, and this is crucial, you need to get Eleanor drunk at the welcome party so she will say and do a bunch of bad stuff."
2,14,Michael,"Then, we take that stuff and use it to build our chaos sequences in the morning."
2,14,Michael,"For example, you remember last time, she stole all the cocktail shrimp, and we made giant nightmare shrimp fly through the sky?"
2,14,Michael,"See, it's those details that make her realize she's in danger of being found out."
2,14,Michael,"Okay, all right, I know that this kind of large-scale deception is not what you were trained to do."
2,14,Michael,"There are gonna be days when you are just sick of being around these disgusting humans, with their weird, gross little mouths and their stupid elbows."
2,14,Michael,"You're gonna be tempted to say, ""Screw it."
2,14,Michael,"Can't we just go back to HQ, and do this the old-fashioned way?"
2,14,Michael,"Pull out some fingernails, toss someone in an acid pit, fire up the old penis flattener?"""
2,14,Michael,"And sure, that sounds nice, but it also sounds easy."
2,14,Michael,We're all here because we believe that there's a better way to make humans miserable.
2,14,Michael,And I I believe in you.
2,14,Michael,"So, torture on three."
2,14,Michael,Ready?
2,14,Michael,"One, two, three"
2,14,All,Torture!
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,And biting!
2,14,Michael,Nope!
2,14,Michael,No.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, lady?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you come back?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Joey?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janine?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jaja?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't I ever listen to people when they talk about themselves?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Chidi, where are you?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or what are you?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A type of soup, maybe?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, there."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor.
2,14,Nina,"Nice to meet you, Eleanor."
2,14,Nina,"I'm Nina, this is my soulmate, Bart."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Love it!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Love people's names, and love learning all about them."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are you all from?
2,14,Ed / Bart,"Well, oddly enough, I was born in Mozambique --"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, do you guys know if there's a neighborhood phone book with everybody's name listed in it?"
2,14,Nina,"Oh, I don't think so, 'cause there's no phones here."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,There are no phones here?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Duh!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no use for 'em.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I always prefer talking to people, anyway."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,People are like nature's apps.
2,14,Nina,Hmm.
2,14,Nina,"Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza."
2,14,Nina,Would you like to join us?
2,14,Nina,"Maybe we could get to know each other a little bit, chat."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I'm good."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm gonna explore a little bit, but it was so nice to meet you, Nina, and --"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bye-bye.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry, I didn't see you."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you Chidi?
2,14,Michael,Eleanor?
2,14,Michael,What are you up to?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey there, Michael."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who was that mysterious gentleman wearing the nightgown?
2,14,Michael,"Oh, uh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who never speaks."
2,14,Michael,Might be a little hard to get to know him.
2,14,Michael,"Eleanor, you and I both know that you're not like everyone else in this neighborhood."
2,14,Michael,Everyone here led a remarkable life.
2,14,Michael,"But you, the work you did as an environmental activist was just extraordinary."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh oh, well, it's the environment."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I loved mushrooms."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can honestly say that.
2,14,Michael,"Well, it paid off because you were the number one point-getter in this entire neighborhood."
2,14,Michael,"And as such, I was hoping you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party to introduce yourself?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,How can I say no?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I say no?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,It doesn't feel like I can say no.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if I can, Michael, I'm saying no."
2,14,Michael,Okay.
2,14,Michael,You'll speak for maybe an hour or so?
2,14,Michael,"Hey, you know what?"
2,14,Michael,I got you something to wear here.
2,14,Michael,All the top point-getters wear these on the first night.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me."
2,14,Chris Baker,"So, long story short, my heart is in the Pope, my liver's in the Dalai Lama, and my teeth were strung into a necklace for a child king in French Polynesia."
2,14,Chris Baker,"But, it got me into the Good Place, so can't complain."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Can I tell you something, just soulmate to soulmate?"
2,14,Chris Baker,Hold that thought.
2,14,Chris Baker,I'm gonna head to the gym.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you serious?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Again, right now?"
2,14,Chris Baker,Yeah.
2,14,Chris Baker,I'll catch you later.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,"Hey, there, Best Person."
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,You must be Eleanor.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,"I'm Jessica, the host."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,Michael told us about your speech.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,I can't wait to hear what you have to say.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Me neither, Jessica."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Me neither.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,"Aw, don't be nervous."
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,"Here, liquid courage."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, um, you know what?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think I need to keep a clear head.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you imagine getting drunk before giving a big speech?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Getting kicked out of your niece's christening and then, only later, once you've sobered up, realized you don't even have a niece?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, who was that kid?"
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,"So, Eleanor, you were an environmental lawyer."
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,That's fascinating.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just don't ask me questions about it.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am sick of describing exactly what it means.
2,14,Bambadjan,"Hey, I'm headed to the bar."
2,14,Bambadjan,Can I grab you something?
2,14,Bambadjan,How about a margarita?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm good."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, I'm the best."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,According to the sash.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,She's still not drinking?
2,14,Bambadjan,Nope.
2,14,Bambadjan,Something's off.
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,Should we
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,No.
2,14,Gayle / Jessica,Keep it together.
2,14,Chuck / Gunnar,Yeah.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Screw it.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Couple of quick shots.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Then I'm coming for you, shrimpies."
2,14,Woman,"Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,These are for you.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Drink up.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is your name Chidi?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Yes?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ah!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew you weren't a soup.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Listen to me carefully.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to talk.
2,14,Michael,Chidi?
2,14,Michael,Come on in.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,There really is an afterlife.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"I can't wait to have breakfast with Kant, lunch with Michel Foucault, dinner with Kant again, so we can talk about what came up at breakfast --"
2,14,Michael,"I'm sorry, Chidi, all the great philosophers in history ended up in the Bad Place."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,All of my heroes are --
2,14,Michael,Being tortured.
2,14,Michael,Yes.
2,14,Michael,I'm afraid so.
2,14,Michael,"Actually, it is kind of clever how they punish philosophers."
2,14,Michael,"Every day, they make them go to school naked."
2,14,Michael,Then they take a test in a class they've never been to.
2,14,Michael,Then they smash them with hammers.
2,14,Michael,That part is not so clever.
2,14,Michael,"But the point is, Chidi, you were way better than all of them."
2,14,Michael,You're safe.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,No way.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Soulmates are real?
2,14,Michael,They sure are.
2,14,Michael,"Although, your soulmate situation is a little unusual."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't have one, do I?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,That's fine.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Who needs a soulmate, anyway?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,My soulmate will be books.
2,14,Michael,"No, no."
2,14,Michael,It's not that you don't have a soulmate.
2,14,Michael,It's that you have multiple soulmates.
2,14,Michael,"Here, now, normally our omniscient system perfectly analyzes each person's profile and matches him or her with another person."
2,14,Michael,"But in your case, the system matched you with two other people."
2,14,Michael,"It's a rare occurrence, like a double rainbow."
2,14,Michael,"Or someone on the Internet saying, ""You know what?"
2,14,Michael,"You've convinced me I was wrong."""
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"So, how do you choose who I should be with?"
2,14,Michael,I don't choose.
2,14,Michael,"You do, Chidi."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,I what?
2,14,Michael,"This is Angelique, Pedro and Pevita."
2,14,Michael,"According to the system, either Pedro or Chidi could be matched perfectly with either Angelique or Pevita."
2,14,Michael,"So, figure it out."
2,14,Michael,Should be fun.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Cool beans.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"One second, guys."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"So, so -- yeah."
2,14,Michael,Yeah?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"So, making decisions isn't necessarily my strong suit."
2,14,Michael,"I know that, buddy."
2,14,Michael,You once had a panic attack at a Make Your Own Sundae bar.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"There were too many toppings and very early in the process, you had to commit to a chocolate palette or a fruit palette."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"If you couldn't decide, you wound up with kiwi, Junior Mint, raisin, and it ruins everyone's night."
2,14,Michael,"Chidi, I am so sorry."
2,14,Michael,I literally cannot choose for you.
2,14,Michael,This has to be your decision.
2,14,Michael,"Buddy, you gotta trust me."
2,14,Michael,I would never place you in a painful situation.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
2,14,Michael,Perfect.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"Here you go, Chidi."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,One slice of Hawaiian straight out the oven for ya.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,I'm Denise.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Welcome to my pizza place.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Thanks, Denise."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,And here's one for you.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Have a nice day.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza's so popular here.
2,14,Angelique,"Yeah, I guess a lot of the residents love it."
2,14,Angelique,"Makes you wonder what type of pizza they have in the Bad Place, huh?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,We must've just missed each other.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,What was your thesis on?
2,14,Angelique,"Oh, gosh."
2,14,Angelique,It was so boring.
2,14,Angelique,"It was called, ""Cultural Relativism and Moral Absolutism: An Exploration of Values As Seen Through the Works of Alain LeRoy Locke and Immanuel Kant""."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,And Immanuel Kant!
2,14,Angelique,Shut up.
2,14,Angelique,You read it?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"No, but that pairing is the most obvious pairing to employ in a paper with that title, and I wanna read it so bad."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,What about Morocco?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,You ever travel there?
2,14,Pevita,No.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,What about anywhere else?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,You been anywhere else?
2,14,Pevita,No.
2,14,Pedro,"So, first impressions?"
2,14,Pedro,Anyone?
2,14,Angelique,I kinda wanna hear what Chidi thinks.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, um, I mean, you're both brilliant, accomplished women, and Pedro, you're great, too."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Just amazing people.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,I'm surrounded.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"But if I had to say who I, sort of, immediately bonded to on a gut level, I think I would say that I kind of feel like my soulmate is Angelique --"
2,14,Michael,Wait!
2,14,Michael,Wait!
2,14,Michael,There was a mistake in the calculations.
2,14,Michael,"We had a four-hour time gap in your profiles on May 10, 2003."
2,14,Michael,"I corrected that day's events for all of you, and ran the numbers again."
2,14,Michael,"And the final result proves definitively that Pedro is Angelique's soulmate, and, Chidi, your soulmate is Pevita."
2,14,Michael,That was close.
2,14,Michael,Hey.
2,14,Michael,"You guys hadn't made a decision yet, had you?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"No, we did not."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"No one said anything, I didn't hear anything, and I certainly didn't say anything."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,That's for darn sure.
2,14,Michael,Okay.
2,14,Michael,All right.
2,14,Michael,See you later.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,This is fun.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,It's a fun party.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,There's no question about it.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,This is a fun situation.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,You guys are here.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"The fun continues, nay, increases."
2,14,Angelique,You two look nice.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Thanks.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,And you look fine.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Would I say you look better than anyone else here?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I wouldn't say that."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Do you look bad?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,No.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"But good, would I go as far as to say is, you look good?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Doubtful.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, wine."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Uh do I feel like red or white?
2,14,Pevita,"Deep down in your heart of hearts, you already know which one you want."
2,14,Janet,Why isn't anyone talking?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?"
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Oh!
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Hey.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"Chidi, right?"
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Denise.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"We met earlier, remember?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, yeah."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Are you limping?
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"Yeah, I am."
2,14,Vicky / Denise,Crazy story.
2,14,Vicky / Denise,"See, I was a trapeze artist in an illegal circus in Bangladesh --"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Angelique.
2,14,Angelique,"Hey, how are you doing?"
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, you know stomach's in knots, I'm stress-grinding my teeth, and it feels like my soul is being suffocated."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, your standard paradise stuff."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,How about you?
2,14,Angelique,It's been a little uncomfortable.
2,14,Angelique,I think Pedro maybe heard you say that thing you were gonna say.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm so sorry, I but I have to ask, do you feel the way I feel?"
2,14,Angelique,We can't talk about this.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"I know, but if the numbers were that close, I think I'm supposed to be with --"
2,14,Angelique,Stop.
2,14,Angelique,"Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,These are for you.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is your name Chidi?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Yes?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ah!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew you weren't a soup!
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Listen to me very carefully.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to talk.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,About what?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just shut your mouth, smile at me and walk over here."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, you're definitely my least favorite person I've met so far."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, this is not a good time."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,I'm in the middle of something --
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, I'm guessing we have about 30 seconds to talk before someone notices."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I got here, some robot lady appeared out of thin air and gave me this."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,You mean Janet.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's it.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet.
2,14,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not now, Janet."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Buzz off.
2,14,Janet,Okay.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, I have no memory of writing this, but it is my handwriting."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's your name, right?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, for some reason, at some point, I put this note into that whatever-lady's robot mouth."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,You already forgot her name.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I didn't."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Her name is Janet.
2,14,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fork off.
2,14,Janet,Okay.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"From the second I got here, these nerds have been acting real weird, trying to get me drunk."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,My soulmate ditches me every time I try to talk to him.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,And this Zen master guy gave me this magic bracelet thing.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then he just ran away.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Something very strange is going on here, and the only person I trust is me."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,And me told me to find you.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, what's the deal?"
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's happening?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you got?
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me, and I've got my own problems to deal with."
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
2,14,Chidi Anagonye,I can't help you.
2,14,Michael,"Attention, everyone!"
2,14,Michael,Speech time.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if you are, please get me out of this speech."
2,14,Michael,"Tahani, come on in."
2,14,Michael,"You're in the Good Place, Tahani."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,What a surprise!
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But, yes, I accept."
2,14,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Tomas."
2,14,Michael,"Now, Tomas was a doctor with the International Rescue Alliance, and you raised money that ultimately funded his medical mission."
2,14,Michael,It's just so perfect.
2,14,Tomas,"It's lovely to meet you, Tahani."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Charmed, I'm short."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sorry, did I just say ""short""?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I meant to say, ""Charmed, I'm sure."""
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Because I am charmed to meet you.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just an unfortunate Freudian short.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Shall we?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Where did you attend medical short?
2,14,Michael,"So, this is the living room, as well as the kitchen and the bedroom."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's so cozy.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I feel like the walls are hugging me.
2,14,Tomas,"Michael, I don't mean to be rude, but this is simply absurd."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I didn't want to say anything, but --"
2,14,Tomas,There's only two of us.
2,14,Tomas,We don't need all this space.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""All this space""?"
2,14,Michael,"Of course, you two humanitarians don't want anything extravagant."
2,14,Michael,I'll just get rid of the second floor.
2,14,Michael,Okay.
2,14,Michael,I'll let you two have some alone time.
2,14,Michael,I'll see you at the party.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, it certainly is quite quaint."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's just fun I dare say, even quite charming oh, no."
2,14,Tomas,What's the matter?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, it's just a self-portrait of my sister."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Wonderful.
2,14,Tomas,Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?
2,14,Tomas,I used to play her music for my patients.
2,14,Tomas,"At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs were curing the malaria for us."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Great.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I best be getting changed for tonight."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can hardly wear a day dress to an evening event.
2,14,Tomas,Sounds good.
2,14,Tomas,I'm ready whenever you are.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that what you're wearing?
2,14,Tomas,"Oh, yeah."
2,14,Tomas,My years treating remote villagers taught me to favor comfort over style.
2,14,Tomas,But you should wear whatever you prefer.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I mean, as we are soulmates, perhaps, I should also dress down."
2,14,Tomas,"You all right, my dear?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just not used to dressing like a plumber-ess.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Is that what you call a female plumber, or is it a toilet sweep?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or clog wench?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In any case, that's how I'm dressed."
2,14,Tomas,"My darling, you are in the Good Place."
2,14,Tomas,Relax.
2,14,Tomas,Feel the breeze on your feet.
2,14,Tomas,That's why Crocs have holes in them.
2,14,Tomas,I'll get us a drink.
2,14,Tomas,"Lower that beautiful face for me, won't you?"
2,14,Tomas,"Lower, lower, lower, lower, lower"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,14,Michael,"Tahani, you all right?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, hello."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, I'm having a splendid time."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Although, if I'm being honest, a few aspects of my day have been sub-optimal."
2,14,Michael,Really?
2,14,Michael,Like what?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, my house is a bit small, which is fine."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just not what I'm used to.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And Tomas is lovely, but we haven't really ""clicked"" yet, to use a mundane colloquialism, which I supposed I should do, now that I'm wearing cargo pants."
2,14,Michael,"Tahani, it's very common to experience adjustment pains."
2,14,Michael,But the system matched you and Tomas.
2,14,Michael,And the system is never wrong.
2,14,Michael,But guess what?
2,14,Michael,This is the Good Place.
2,14,Michael,"If you want your house to be larger, then just ask."
2,14,Michael,Do you want something this big?
2,14,Michael,"Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal."
2,14,Michael,"I know, I know."
2,14,Michael,How about a moon?
2,14,Michael,Would you like to live on your own private moon?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,My house is wonderful.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's so silly to want a bigger house, of all things, here in paradise."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, no."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,No changes needed.
2,14,Michael,Okay.
2,14,Michael,"But if you change your mind, just ask."
2,14,Michael,"Because all the other residents are very happy, so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with whatever requests you make."
2,14,Michael,"No demand is too, what's the word, frivolous."
2,14,Michael,Okay?
2,14,Michael,Wow.
2,14,Michael,That is rough.
2,14,Angelique,"Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,These are for you.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Drink up.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I --
2,14,Glenn,Hey!
2,14,Glenn,Twinsies.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry?
2,14,Glenn,Look.
2,14,Glenn,Cargo pants buddies.
2,14,Glenn,I bet we have a lot in common.
2,14,Glenn,I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
2,14,Glenn,How about you?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,14,Glenn,Crocs also?
2,14,Michael,Speech time!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if you are, please get me out of this speech."
2,14,Michael,I've asked our top point-getter here to say a few words.
2,14,Michael,"So, take it away, Eleanor."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The dictionary defines ""best"" as being --"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, God."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Boring.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thank you, wizard."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am Tahani.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Tahani am me.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And even though I wasn't a ""number one point-getter"", I want to welcome you all to the neighborhood."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You all look so beautiful tonight, with your regular-size pockets, regular-size soulmates no offense, darling, wherever you are."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Probably somewhere down there.
2,14,Michael,Why don't you try to ease her off the stage and take over?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The point is, we're all good people, right?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We all did the right thing, whenever we could."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,And that's why it's so nice to be here among you in this massive house that I want.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,I want this house.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give it.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I'm kidding."
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But really, give me the house."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey there, hot stuff."
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I get you a cup of coffee?
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Get your hands off me.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You think you're better than I am, don't you?"
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just 'cause you're wearing that.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look at that terrible placement and angle.
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is this your first time wearing a sash?
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,It is.
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I think if we all just take a break --
2,14,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give it to me!
2,14,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got her off the stage.
2,15,Michael,"Jianyu, come on in."
2,15,Michael,"Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk who kept a vow of silence."
2,15,Michael,"Would you prefer to remain silent here, as well?"
2,15,Michael,Every resident here in the Good Place has a soulmate.
2,15,Michael,"Now, some of the pairings are platonic, some are romantic."
2,15,Michael,But what you have with your soulmate is unique.
2,15,Michael,You have a spiritual connection that transcends the physical realm.
2,15,Michael,This person's gonna be your best bud.
2,15,Michael,"Jianyu, let me introduce you to your soulmate, Luang."
2,15,Michael,He is also a Buddhist monk from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.
2,15,Michael,You and Luang share an identical soul.
2,15,Michael,"Like binary stars, orbiting one another in a perfect reflective harmony."
2,15,Michael,You won't ever have a single moment of loneliness because you'll always be right next to each other.
2,15,Michael,For eternity.
2,15,Michael,I'll let you two get acquainted.
2,15,Michael,I'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.
2,15,Michael,"Because well, you get it, you get it."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't see you.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you Chidi?
2,15,Michael,Eleanor?
2,15,Michael,What are you up to?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey there, Michael."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who was that mysterious gentleman?
2,15,Michael,"Hello, you beautiful spirits."
2,15,Michael,Can I offer you two something to drink?
2,15,Michael,Janet.
2,15,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,15,Michael,This is Janet.
2,15,Michael,"Now, she can get you literally anything you want."
2,15,Michael,All you have to do is ask.
2,15,Michael,"Of course, you two won't ever want anything because you're perfectly content."
2,15,Michael,"Oh, I know."
2,15,Michael,How about something special?
2,15,Michael,"Janet, two yak's milks, please."
2,15,Michael,Enjoy.
2,15,Michael,Speech time!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,If we all take a break --
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give it to me!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got her off the stage.
2,15,Michael,Tahani?
2,15,Michael,Are you all right?
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fine.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Never better.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Top of my game, actually."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,You'll have to excuse me.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've got to go.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Got some shrimp in one of my many, many cargo pants pockets."
2,15,Michael,What the fork is happening?
2,15,Michael,"Okay, here we go."
2,15,Michael,"How's it going, boss man?"
2,15,Shawn,Enough chit-chat.
2,15,Shawn,Is everything in place for version two?
2,15,Michael,Yep.
2,15,Michael,I've thought of everything.
2,15,Michael,I won't let you down.
2,15,Michael,I'm hoping you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party to introduce yourself?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,How can I say no?
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,So cozy.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I feel like the walls are hugging me.
2,15,Michael,How about something special?
2,15,Michael,"Janet, two yak's milks, please."
2,15,Janet,Why isn't anyone talking?
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?"
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"Michael, may I please speak with you privately?"
2,15,Michael,Sure.
2,15,Michael,Sure.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"It just feels like I used to be ""real"" Eleanor, and now I'm Denise."
2,15,Michael,"Denise is a good part, with a great backstory."
2,15,Michael,You run the best pizza place in the neighborhood.
2,15,Michael,"You have a cat, and that's cool."
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"I took this job because it seemed fun and different, and in the original version, I got to break Chidi's heart 20 times and it was great."
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"I mean, he was miserable."
2,15,Vicky / Denise,And now Angelique gets to torture him?
2,15,Vicky / Denise,Angelique is a hack.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,I can act circles around her.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,But I have nothing to do.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"I am a Ferrari, okay?"
2,15,Vicky / Denise,And you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.
2,15,Michael,I hear your concern.
2,15,Michael,I do.
2,15,Michael,"And I promise you, there is a great arc coming for Denise, the pizza lady, in about 80 years or so."
2,15,Michael,Chidi is going to accidentally kill your cat.
2,15,Michael,It's gonna give you a great chance to shine.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,Can I just have something that makes me stand out?
2,15,Vicky / Denise,A mysterious past or a limp?
2,15,Vicky / Denise,I want a limp.
2,15,Michael,This is supposed to be the Good Place.
2,15,Michael,Why would you --
2,15,Michael,Okay.
2,15,Michael,"No, I hear you."
2,15,Michael,I tell you what.
2,15,Michael,"Go nuts, right?"
2,15,Michael,Limp your heart out.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,Hey.
2,15,Vicky / Denise,"Chidi, right?"
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Are you limping?
2,15,Michael,How's it going?
2,15,Gayle / Jessica,We're having some trouble with Eleanor.
2,15,Gayle / Jessica,She's not engaging in conversation.
2,15,Gayle / Jessica,She's not drinking.
2,15,Michael,Eleanor's not drinking?
2,15,Michael,She brought a flask in the car during her driver's test.
2,15,Michael,"Okay, we need to keep things moving here."
2,15,Michael,I'm about to make her talk for an hour.
2,15,Michael,She'll definitely end up insulting somebody.
2,15,Michael,Speech time!
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We're all good people, right?"
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We all did the right thing, whenever we could."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,If we all take a break --
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give it to me!
2,15,Michael,Tahani?
2,15,Michael,Are you all right?
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fine.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Never better.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,You'll have to excuse me.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Come here.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've got to go.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the fork, man?"
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I know that book.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is that a nerd pickup line?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because it's only kind of working.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,No.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,The note you showed me before?
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"Right, this is from a book called What We Owe to Each Other."
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I used to teach it.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, brag much?"
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I'm trying to help you.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"I've never seen you before in my life, but I think, somehow, we know each other."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That definitely sounded like a pickup line, and I'm not not interested, but we need to figure this out first."
2,15,Luang,"It's not that bad, right?"
2,15,Luang,"I mean, we got a drunken speech."
2,15,Luang,That's good.
2,15,Michael,No.
2,15,Michael,It isn't.
2,15,Michael,Tahani gave the drunken speech instead of Eleanor.
2,15,Michael,"We can't build a chaos sequence out of Tahani's speech because she thinks she belongs here, ya ding-dong."
2,15,Michael,Okay.
2,15,Michael,We can still salvage this.
2,15,Michael,Where's Eleanor?
2,15,Angelique,She's gone.
2,15,Angelique,I can't find her anywhere.
2,15,Bambadjan,Maybe she left with Chidi?
2,15,Bambadjan,"He's gone, too."
2,15,Michael,What?
2,15,Luang,Or maybe she left with Jason.
2,15,Michael,You lost Jason?
2,15,Michael,How's that even possible?
2,15,Michael,Your only job is to stand next to that idiot.
2,15,Luang,I got distracted by the fire.
2,15,Luang,I love fire.
2,15,Luang,"You know, my main job is to burn people with fire."
2,15,Chris Baker,"What's up, guys?"
2,15,Michael,What are you doing here?
2,15,Michael,Why aren't you with Eleanor?
2,15,Chris Baker,I told her I was going to the gym again.
2,15,Michael,Why would you say that in the middle of a party?
2,15,Chris Baker,You told me to.
2,15,Michael,No.
2,15,Michael,I didn't.
2,15,Chris Baker,"You said, if Eleanor tries to confess that she doesn't belong here, find a reason to avoid her."
2,15,Chris Baker,"Like saying, ""I'm going to the gym."""
2,15,Chris Baker,That's what I've been saying.
2,15,Michael,That was a suggestion of the type of thing you could say.
2,15,Michael,Don't how many times have you specifically told her you were going to the gym?
2,15,Chris Baker,"Five no, nine."
2,15,Michael,You dimwit!
2,15,Chris Baker,"Hey, man."
2,15,Chris Baker,I was perfectly happy in my old job in the twisting department.
2,15,Chris Baker,"People came in, and I'd twist them until they snapped in half, and I'd moved on to the next one."
2,15,Chris Baker,But this job is weird!
2,15,Chris Baker,"It's all talk, no twisting."
2,15,Chris Baker,"If you don't like the way I do it, get somebody else."
2,15,Chris Baker,I'm going to the gym!
2,15,Michael,Fine.
2,15,Michael,"Yeah, you do that."
2,15,Michael,You go to the gym.
2,15,Michael,Okay.
2,15,Michael,We can still pull this off.
2,15,Michael,We just need to find the four humans.
2,15,Michael,Okay?
2,15,Michael,Okay.
2,15,Michael,Right now.
2,15,Michael,"Everyone in this room, find those four humans!"
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you gonna talk or walk around like a nerd trying to get a personal best on his Fitbit?
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I'm trying to process a tremendous amount of insane information.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you're not supposed to be here."
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,But you and I clearly met here somehow before now.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Does that mean I'm not supposed to be here?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know, dude."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Were you a good person on Earth?
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,I think so.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"I spent my life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the oh, no!"
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"I used almond milk in my coffee, even though I knew about the negative environmental impact."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, what do we do?"
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know, dude!"
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we better figure it out soon or we're doomed.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Uh Janet?
2,15,Janet,"Hi, there, Jianyu."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, Janet."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Can I tell you something?
2,15,Janet,Sure.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,I'm not Jianyu.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,And I'm not a silent monk.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,My real name is Jason.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,I don't know what's going on.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"I got here and Michael said I'm a monk, and he told me I was gonna have a new best friend, and that we were going to live in a yogurt."
2,15,Janet,A yurt.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"Yurt, for short."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,I was psyched to meet my new best friend.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,But he turned out to be this weird silent guy that won't leave me alone.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,I don't want to go back to my yogurt.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Can I go to your house?
2,15,Janet,"I don't have a house, Jason."
2,15,Janet,I live in a boundless void.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Can I go there?
2,15,Janet,No.
2,15,Janet,It's a boundless void.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
2,15,Janet,"So, what you're saying is, there are certain aspects of your existence here in the Good Place that are confusing for you?"
2,15,Janet,And you're searching for someplace to go where you feel less lonely.
2,15,Janet,I know somewhere you could go.
2,15,Janet,Why did you do that?
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Because you were nice to me.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,You're my friend.
2,15,Janet,Okay.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"If we got all the way to Scanlon, we must have been studying very intensely for a long time."
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,"Or you grabbed a random book of mine, and tore a page out."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll be honest.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds more like me.
2,15,Michael,Ah!
2,15,Michael,Eleanor and Chidi.
2,15,Michael,What a pleasant surprise.
2,15,Michael,I'm so happy you two have met.
2,15,Michael,"I'm just going door-to-door, apologizing for the commotion earlier tonight."
2,15,Michael,The first night in the afterlife can be a little overwhelming.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't worry about us, Michael."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,We are doing fine.
2,15,Michael,"Oh, good."
2,15,Michael,Glad to hear that.
2,15,Michael,"Well, it's getting late."
2,15,Michael,"Chidi, allow me to escort you back to your house."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, all."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry for the late hour.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, I wanted to stop by and give you back your sash."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's okay.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can just keep it.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't deserve it.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I made a complete fool of myself tonight.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I interrupted your big speech, badly stained my cargo pants which, I have to admit, are quite comfortable."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, God, what's happened to me?"
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm praising off-the-rack separates.
2,15,Michael,"Tahani, please, it's late."
2,15,Michael,What we should do --
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, ever since I got here, it feels like something's been off."
2,15,Tomas,Tahani.
2,15,Tomas,There you are.
2,15,Tomas,I've been worried sick about you.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's her soulmate?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a second one of him that stands on his shoulders?
2,15,Pevita,"Chidi, there you are."
2,15,Pevita,I've been worried sick about you.
2,15,Michael,Okay.
2,15,Michael,"All right, everybody, now we are really imposing on Eleanor here."
2,15,Michael,"Chidi, let's everybody take off --"
2,15,Janet,"Hey, Eleanor this person would like to speak with you."
2,15,Janet,Privately.
2,15,Janet,About something.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, really?"
2,15,Janet,Yep.
2,15,Janet,Bye.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the wise monk who gave me the magic amulet.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,I gotta figure out what it means.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Could be the key to this mystery.
2,15,Michael,Luang.
2,15,Michael,Perfect.
2,15,Michael,Why don't you take Jianyu back to your yurt?
2,15,Michael,Right away.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"Homie, no."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,I'm not spending another second with this loser.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"You said he was going to be my best friend, but he is not."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,My best friend from Jacksonville was named Pillboi and he was dope!
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"We would talk together, get high together, throw old batteries at drones together, but this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I no longer think he's a wise monk, and I'm pretty sure this is just a piece of garbage."
2,15,Chris Baker,"Babe, there you are."
2,15,Chris Baker,I've been worried --
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me stop you.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I guess?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've been worried sick about me.
2,15,Chris Baker,I'm headed to the gym.
2,15,Michael,Sure.
2,15,Michael,Why not?
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm quite confused.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let me explain, gorgeous."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know what this place is, but it is certainly not the Good Place."
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael is forking with us.
2,15,Jason Mendoza,Like a prank show?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like a prank show!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Except, according to this note, it's a prank show we've all been on before."
2,15,Michael,What note?
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Apparently, I wrote myself a note, and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth."
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Janet.
2,15,Chidi Anagonye,Her name is Janet.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet.
2,15,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,15,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, Janet."
2,15,Janet,"Hi, Jason."
2,15,Michael,Are you kidding me?
2,15,Michael,"Eleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little so-and-so."
2,15,Michael,That was some very quick thinking.
2,15,Michael,I'm extremely impressed.
2,15,Michael,"And, to be honest, I'm relieved."
2,15,Michael,At least there's an explanation for why this all went south so fast.
2,15,Michael,But you won't be so lucky next time.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Next time?
2,15,Michael,Yeah.
2,15,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's going to do it again.
2,15,Michael,"That's not going to work this time, dummy."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excuse me.
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable."
2,15,Tahani Al-Jamil,I demand to speak to your superior.
2,15,Michael,"I am so sorry, madam."
2,15,Michael,Please forgive me.
2,15,Michael,"Well, as humans like to say, ""Third time's the charm."""
2,15,Michael,Right?
2,15,Michael,I take full responsibility for the false start.
2,15,Michael,"But I assure you all, there is no note this time."
2,15,Michael,I'll prove it to you.
2,15,Michael,Janet!
2,15,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,15,Michael,"Hi, Janet."
2,15,Michael,"Open your mouth, please."
2,15,Michael,Thank you.
2,15,Michael,"See, no notes, no clues or loopholes."
2,15,Michael,Nothing in there.
2,15,Michael,"Thank you, Janet."
2,15,Michael,"So, let's all pretend the last attempt never even happened."
2,15,Michael,Questions.
2,15,Gayle / Jessica,"Maybe it's none of our business, but did you tell Shawn what happened?"
2,15,Michael,"Yes, I did."
2,15,Michael,And he completely understood.
2,15,Michael,"As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing kind of funny."
2,15,Michael,But he was very supportive.
2,15,Michael,He says he's very excited for us to get going again.
2,15,Michael,"So, anyone else?"
2,15,Michael,Anybody?
2,15,Michael,No?
2,15,Michael,Let's get out there and make some miseries.
2,15,Michael,"Testing, one, two, three."
2,15,Michael,"Hey there, boss man."
2,15,Shawn,"You were supposed to call me this morning, give me an update."
2,15,Michael,Right.
2,15,Michael,Sorry.
2,15,Michael,Yeah.
2,15,Michael,"It's just, the, um the chaos sequence was going so well."
2,15,Michael,"Better than the first time, in my opinion."
2,15,Michael,Eleanor got completely drunk last night.
2,15,Michael,"She talked for an hour, even flashed somebody."
2,15,Michael,"So, we had a lot to work with."
2,15,Shawn,So attempt number two is on track so far?
2,15,Michael,Smooth as silk.
2,15,Michael,Everything's great.
2,15,Michael,"Oh sounds like everything's going well back there, too."
2,15,Shawn,We're trying out the new butthole spiders.
2,15,Michael,Ah!
2,15,Shawn,They're enormous.
2,15,Shawn,"You know, good old-fashioned torture."
2,15,Shawn,The way it's supposed to be.
2,15,Shawn,Good luck with attempt number two.
2,15,Shawn,"And, remember, there will be no attempt number three."
2,15,Michael,"Eleanor, come on in."
2,16,Michael,This is daily notes log for attempt number three of my neighborhood experiment.
2,16,Michael,"Obviously, I hope and assume this will be the final version."
2,16,Michael,"No, I know it will be."
2,16,Michael,All the kinks have been worked out.
2,16,Michael,This is the one.
2,16,Michael,"And after I pull this off, they're gonna hang my picture in the Bad Place Hall of Fame, right next to the guy who invented bees with teeth."
2,16,Michael,"You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,16,Chris Baker,I'm Chris Baker.
2,16,Chris Baker,I'm your soulmate.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bring it in, man."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, I must ask."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Why are you wearing a sash that says ""Best Person"" on it?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Apparently, I am the number one points-getter in the entire neighborhood."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that so?
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,I always have to have my sashes custom-made due to my height and bosom size.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Also, apparently, sashes are out this season."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,The diagonal line really draws one's eye to the chin bloat.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe."
2,16,Michael,Run!
2,16,Michael,Giraffes!
2,16,Michael,Giraffes!
2,16,Michael,Run!
2,16,Michael,Mean giraffes are destroying the neighborhood.
2,16,Michael,Gah!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, robot slave lady?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Busty Alexa?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Janet?"
2,16,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still not used to it.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, hey."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What if I, an already amazing person who definitely belongs here, wanted to learn even more about how to be a good person?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher or a life coach or an Instagram fitness model or something?"
2,16,Janet,"Eleanor, I'd like you to meet Chidi Anagonye."
2,16,Janet,"Chidi, this is Eleanor."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet tells me you were a professor of some kind.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, focusing on deontology."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hang on one second, Cheebee."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Um
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This guy's too big of a nerd.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who else you got?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, what do we do here?"
2,16,Michael,I don't know.
2,16,Michael,"Apparently, the Bad Place knows one of you belongs down there with them, and they want that person to get inside the obelisk, or they're gonna take all of you."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,I can't go!
2,16,Jason Mendoza,I'm too young to die!
2,16,Jason Mendoza,And too old to eat off the kids' menu!
2,16,Jason Mendoza,What a stupid age I am!
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'd never survive down there.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,They should take Eleanor.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,She's a pear shape.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,She'd fit right in.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, excuse me?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,You wish you could have a bite of this pear.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,I'll go!
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,I deserve to go.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,You can stay.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, you're not going."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yes!"
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I have to go."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy forking shirt!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You guys, don't you get it?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael is torturing us.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why our lives have been so miserable since the moment we got here.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This isn't the Good Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's the Bad Place.
2,16,Michael,"Ah, farts."
2,16,Michael,Okay.
2,16,Michael,Attempt number 11.
2,16,Michael,Let's focus on the positives.
2,16,Michael,Eleanor always hates her house.
2,16,Michael,Tahani always hates Eleanor.
2,16,Michael,Jason hates being quiet.
2,16,Michael,Chidi immediately gets a stomachache.
2,16,Michael,So there's a lot to work with here.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hang on one second, Cheeto."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,So it's gonna be a hard pass on superdork Jones over there.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Anybody else you got to teach me?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,You guys ready for our lesson?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,We're talking David Hume today.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Bundle theory of the self, baby."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sounds like a real banger, but you guys gotta scram."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My soulmate has some sort of surprise planned for me, and he seems excited about it."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, you two are certainly getting along very well these days."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I'm actually kind of into Sebastian lately."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, he's a little hokey, but he's growing on me a little bit."
2,16,Sebastian,My love.
2,16,Sebastian,My sweet dewdrop.
2,16,Sebastian,I have written you a three-hour spoken-word jazz opera.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool!
2,16,Sebastian,"Eleanor, less and more."
2,16,Sebastian,Who's it for?
2,16,Sebastian,"For you, my dewdrop."
2,16,Sebastian,Cream of the crop.
2,16,Sebastian,"Top to the bop, to the bop, to the top."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, no."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,16,Sebastian,What?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,No version of heaven for anyone would ever include three hours of this.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're in the Bad Place, aren't we?"
2,16,Michael,Damn it.
2,16,Michael,"That was a real trip for biscuits, and now we're all wet, daddio."
2,16,Vicky,I never even got to play my stupid triangle.
2,16,Janet,"No, no, no, no, Michael!"
2,16,Janet,"Please, please!"
2,16,Janet,Please don't kill me.
2,16,Janet,I have so much to live for.
2,16,Michael,"I'm sorry, Janet."
2,16,Michael,Gotta reboot you every time I start over.
2,16,Janet,"Oh, I know."
2,16,Janet,I'm not actually upset.
2,16,Janet,It's the automatic fail-safe mechanism that kicks in every time you approach the plunger.
2,16,Janet,Go ahead.
2,16,Janet,"Michael, you monster!"
2,16,Michael,Attempt 32.
2,16,Michael,Attempt 57.
2,16,Michael,Attempt 99.
2,16,Michael,Attempt 108.
2,16,Michael,I've analyzed some recent data.
2,16,Michael,"Eleanor always seems to realize they are in the Bad Place, just at the moment --"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Excuse me?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, the door was open so I just came in."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did you say I'm in the Bad Place?
2,16,Michael,Attempt 109.
2,16,Michael,I've closed and locked the door.
2,16,Michael,Yep.
2,16,Michael,And we're ready to go.
2,16,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Greg."
2,16,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Glenn."
2,16,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Tahani."
2,16,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Lerf."
2,16,Michael,"This is your soulmate, a golden retriever."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hang on.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wait a minute.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy smokes.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,The pig's gettin' angry!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Bees!
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Bees!
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Bees!
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Bees!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Shh!
2,16,Janet,Michael!
2,16,Janet,Michael!
2,16,Janet,"If I am gone, who will take care of my birds?"
2,16,Janet,"Michael, no, no, no."
2,16,Janet,"I'm pregnant, and it's your baby."
2,16,Janet,I have tickets to Hamilton next week.
2,16,Janet,And there's a rumor that Daveed Diggs is coming back!
2,16,Michael,"Janet, we've been through this hundreds of times."
2,16,Michael,Can you just chill out?
2,16,Michael,"Is that possible, Janet?"
2,16,Michael,Can you chill out a little?
2,16,Janet,Nope.
2,16,Janet,It's gonna be the same every time.
2,16,Michael,Yeah.
2,16,Michael,"Yeah, I know."
2,16,Janet,"No, no, no!"
2,16,Janet,"No, Michael!"
2,16,Michael,Please calm down.
2,16,Michael,Calm down.
2,16,Michael,All right!
2,16,Michael,"Okay, calm down!"
2,16,Michael,Calm down!
2,16,Michael,"I mean, why even bother at this point?"
2,16,Michael,I'm obviously never gonna get it right.
2,16,Michael,"""I'm Eleanor."
2,16,Michael,I'm so smart.
2,16,Michael,"I'm actually in the Bad Place."""
2,16,Michael,Shawn still thinks I'm on Version Two.
2,16,Michael,I just keep lying to him.
2,16,Michael,It's really bad.
2,16,Michael,"But I I mean, I have to keep trying."
2,16,Michael,I'm in too deep.
2,16,Michael,And I'm really fat right now.
2,16,Michael,I'm stress-eating and I'm gaining weight in my thighs.
2,16,Michael,"I mean, look at that."
2,16,Michael,Ugh!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,So sorry.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,And where am I?
2,16,Michael,It doesn't matter.
2,16,Michael,This one doesn't even count.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hang on one second, Chilly."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This guy sucks.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who else you got?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,I can hear you.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, you cannot expect Chidi to decide whether Eleanor goes to the Bad Place."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Yo!
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Yo!
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, homies, check it."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,There's something messed up with this place.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"We keep fighting with each other, none of the TVs get the NFL RedZone channel."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,My soulmate doesn't even know who Blake Bortles is.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"I know this sounds crazy, but I think we're in the Bad Place."
2,16,Michael,Jason figured it out?
2,16,Michael,Jason?
2,16,Michael,This is a real low point.
2,16,Michael,"Yeah, this one hurts."
2,16,Michael,Ow!
2,16,Michael,Okay.
2,16,Michael,This might be the one.
2,16,Michael,We're a week in.
2,16,Michael,"Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it."
2,16,Michael,Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.
2,16,Michael,Everyone's miserable.
2,16,Michael,I'm so happy.
2,16,Michael,Fingers crossed.
2,16,Michael,"Vicky, where is everyone?"
2,16,Vicky,"They're not coming, Michael."
2,16,Vicky,You have lost control of this experiment.
2,16,Vicky,So we are on a strike until our demands are met.
2,16,Vicky,"I speak for the entire crew, Michael."
2,16,Vicky,We're sick of it.
2,16,Vicky,We can barely remember what we're supposed to be doing anymore.
2,16,Vicky,"Plus, I spent weeks perfecting this excellent Australian accent, I did."
2,16,Vicky,And then I never got a chance to use it.
2,16,Michael,You're still upset about the size of your part?
2,16,Vicky,Yes!
2,16,Vicky,I want a more important role.
2,16,Vicky,But that's just my demand.
2,16,Vicky,All 318 of us have something we want to do differently.
2,16,Michael,Some people want bigger houses.
2,16,Michael,Gayle wants a different backstory where she was an MMA fighter?
2,16,Michael,Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble on humans while they sleep.
2,16,Michael,"You do know, Vicky, that if I were to do some of these, that it would be a dead giveaway."
2,16,Vicky,And I can help you explain that to them.
2,16,Vicky,"But some of these are doable, and you're gonna do 'em."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Aristotle believes your character is voluntary, because uh, are you ignoring me right now?"
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"It's day two of our ethics lessons, and you're already tuning out?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, sorry."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just got distracted for a second.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,The last thing I remember you saying is nothing.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you start from the beginning?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,I need a little break.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Can we take a walk or something?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe get some clam chowder?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Where is everyone?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who knows?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe they finally figured out clam chowder is disgusting 'cause it's basically a savory latte with bugs in it.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is someone smoking a cigar?
2,16,Glenn,Michael really screwed this up.
2,16,Glenn,The regular Bad Place was fine.
2,16,Glenn,"If the four-headed flying bears ain't broke, don't fix 'em."
2,16,Kamaria,What was wrong with impaling?
2,16,Kamaria,I loved impaling.
2,16,Kamaria,"Hey, Todd?"
2,16,Kamaria,Got a light?
2,16,Toddrick Hemple,"Uh, yeah."
2,16,Toddrick Hemple,Obviously I have a light.
2,16,Toddrick Hemple,"You know, you guys aren't supposed to be smoking."
2,16,Glenn,You're supposed to keep your human suit on.
2,16,Toddrick Hemple,Those suits are really itchy for us.
2,16,Kamaria,Who even cares if they see us?
2,16,Kamaria,They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the Bad Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I forking knew it!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,And clam chowder is disgusting.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's just hot ocean milk with dead animal croutons.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,What do we do?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Panic?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Freak?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"I usually panic, but I am happy to freak."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, we have to stay cool."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"As my mom always used to stay, ""If a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack, there's always something you can gnaw through."""
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Your mom always said that?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Think.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, brain!"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet!
2,16,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,16,Janet,How can I help you?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Um --
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,How do we know she's not a part of it?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we gotta risk it.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can we, um, like, leave the neighborhood?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get as far away as possible?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there anywhere we can go?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"So, we're in the Bad Place, and I know why."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Almond milk.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"I knew it was bad for the environment, but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Who else is being tortured?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Are we the only two?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I gotta assume Jason is as well.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jianyu.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know him as Jianyu, but his real name is Jason."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,And he's a dirtbag from Florida.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, Tahani is a candidate, as far as I'm concerned."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yesterday, she told me that she was Taylor Swift's best friend, but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,She sucks.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"No offense, but I can't believe you and I ended up in the same place."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I always assumed the afterlife was full of cool people, not talking sweater-vests."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,You --
2,16,Janet,We're here.
2,16,Janet,Aren't trains neat?
2,16,Janet,Choo choo!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,You gotta help us.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is Chidi.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, see, we thought we were in the Good Place, but as it turns out --"
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, guys."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,I know.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,You've been here 15 times already.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Did you bring the cocaine I asked for?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Please tell me you somehow remembered this time.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Mama needs her medicine.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,We've met before?
2,16,Janet,I'm Janet.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,I know.
2,16,Michael,"Vicky, let's look at the big picture here."
2,16,Michael,"Now, if you all can just stick with my plan and we pull it off, we'll be heroes."
2,16,Michael,You could write your own ticket.
2,16,Michael,You might even land the Jared from Subway account.
2,16,Vicky,Yeah.
2,16,Vicky,But I don't think you can pull it off.
2,16,Vicky,You can't even pull off those bow ties.
2,16,Michael,That was very mean.
2,16,Michael,But I'm gonna move past that in the name of unit cohesion.
2,16,Vicky,"You're gonna reboot those four dum-dums one more time, and then I'm taking over."
2,16,Vicky,I'm going to execute my version of this neighborhood.
2,16,Vicky,"You see, I've been working on it while all of your versions fell apart."
2,16,Michael,This is insubordination.
2,16,Michael,"And if you do not do what I tell you immediately, you are going down."
2,16,Vicky,That's a complete report of every mistake you've made.
2,16,Vicky,"Every screw-up, every reboot, all laid out in excruciating detail."
2,16,Vicky,"Now, I'm sure your boss would love to hear all about how ""Attempt Number Two"" is really going."
2,16,Vicky,"So, actually, if you don't do what I say, you're going down."
2,16,Vicky,Down under.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it always the three of us?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Usually Chidi's in the mix.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Sometimes Jason is here.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,One time Jason and Tahani were here.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"But, you know what?"
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"No matter what the combo is, I always ask you guys to bring me cocaine next time and you never do."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Do you have anything I can snort?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Like a crushed-up aspirin or some eye shadow or cocaine?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still no.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There's only one question we need to answer right now, and that is: what do we do next?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe we should stay here forever.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Maybe we should stay here forever.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,You always say that.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,And you always end up going back.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"I mean, sometimes you go back because you feel bad your friends don't know what you know."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Sometimes you go back because you walk in on me while I'm masturbating.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,And sometimes you go back because I walk in on you while I'm masturbating.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"But no matter what, you always go back."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"You formulate a plan to defeat Michael, and you head back."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, a plan."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,We need a plan.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,But
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,What if we come up with a plan we've already tried before?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,What if we come up with a plan we've already tried before?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Will you please stop that?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Will you please stop that?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Yeah.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Just to help you out a little, I've written down every plan you've ever come up with, which obviously never worked because you're here and you're back, so good luck."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Physically attack Michael."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Seduce Michael.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Make Michael think he's the one in the Bad Place.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Catch that magic panda, use her powers."""
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,That guy has no idea what's going on.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Hello?
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Hello?
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Where is everyone?
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Janet?
2,16,Michael,"Hey there, Jason."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, hey, homie."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"Uh I mean, Jason?"
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Who is Jason?
2,16,Jason Mendoza,I am a monk.
2,16,Michael,You know what?
2,16,Michael,Can I talk to you for a second?
2,16,Michael,"I'm in a tight spot, and I could use someone to bounce some ideas off of, okay?"
2,16,Michael,"Oh, yeah, uh, real quick you're really in the Bad Place, and you're being tortured."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,What?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know it says here that we already tried throwing Tahani under the bus, but maybe we should revisit that."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Throw her a little bit harder.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe under a bigger bus.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think?
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,I think this is pointless.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,We are trapped in a warped version of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, cool!"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,More philosophy!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,That'll help us.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, don't you see the problem?"
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"We are experiencing karma, but we can't learn from our mistakes because our memories keep getting erased."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,It's an epistemological nightmare.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Even your nightmares are boring.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"You are so mean, Eleanor."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,You're just like those childhood bullies who said I would never get tenure.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you are so irritating!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In one of these reboots, I probably strangled you and then went to the Even Worse Place."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,But you know what?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet it was worth it.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, nice."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, can I just vent to you?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi is so annoying.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just I cannot believe that he is the one I'm stuck here with.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Uh-huh.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Wow.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Crazy.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Jeez, man, I thought you could be human for, like, two seconds and listen to me."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"I have, Eleanor."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,I have listened to you talk about Chidi 15 times in 15 different ways.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Let me cut to the chase.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,You two?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,You got it bad for each other.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, we don't."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi's a friend.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,What am I saying?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not even a friend.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's a weird teacher that I hate.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, I do not wanna watch Cannonball Run II right now."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or all right.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What happened in the first one, so I'm all caught up?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know what's gonna happen to us, but I need to tell you something."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love you.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel."
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you, too."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very funny.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,But that's obviously not real.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, that's real, baby."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,That's real nasty.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, this was the sixth time you guys were here."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"I saw you getting sexy the previous three times, so I cut a little hole in the wall so I could tape ya."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Call it my lookin' hole.
2,16,Chidi Anagonye,Is that a camera?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mindy.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,You pervert!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,How many times have Chidi and I slept together?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Eight different days, but, like, 20 different sessions."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,And how many times did we say that stuff?
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, only once."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, God, I hated it."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"It, like, really killed the vibe for me."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"See, after I watched the porno I made starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,It's like anti-porn.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've only ever said ""I love you"" to two men my entire life."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and a guy in a dark club, who I mistook for ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, why would you show me that?"
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,I don't know.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"You guys are, like, trapped here together."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,I feel bad.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"You know, I'm rooting for you guys."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There is no ""us guys""."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,We basically just met each other.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"No, Eleanor."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,You guys have known each other a really long time.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Also, it doesn't matter if I told you that or not, because when Michael finds out he's failed again, he'll just reboot you."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, Janet, we're leaving!"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am taking this with me.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, no."
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,It's my only copy.
2,16,Mindy St. Claire,Don't.
2,16,Michael,How did it come to this?
2,16,Michael,I was just trying to do something innovative and different that would improve the way we make humans' lives miserable for eternity.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Hmm.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Well
2,16,Michael,Shut up.
2,16,Michael,What are my options?
2,16,Michael,Do I have any?
2,16,Michael,"I mean, I can't go along with her plan."
2,16,Michael,It'll be a spectacular failure.
2,16,Michael,"But I can't ignore her, or she'll rat me out to Shawn."
2,16,Michael,I'm trapped.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"You're saying a lot of words right now, and I only know some of them, like ""rat"" and ""Jason""."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,But I know a little wisdom I can give you.
2,16,Michael,"I know everything that happened in your life, and it was all stupid, so I highly doubt that."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,I was a member of a 60-person dance crew in Jacksonville.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"We were called ""Dance Dance Resolution: We Resolve to Dance""."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight because I'd framed his girlfriend for boogie board theft."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"So he started a new dance crew called ""hashtag DougLife"", and immediately challenged us to a dance-off."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"He said, ""Meet us inside the abandoned orange juice factory at midnight."""
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"That night, as the clock struck 12:00, me and my crew came together, with a determination we had never shown before and slashed all their tires."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,It was dope.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,The end.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,By Jason Mendoza.
2,16,Michael,"You know, that inane story actually contains a bit of good advice."
2,16,Michael,"Thank you, Jason."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,"You got it, homie."
2,16,Jason Mendoza,I give good advice.
2,16,Jason Mendoza,Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.
2,16,Michael,Oh!
2,16,Michael,There you guys are.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stop!
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,No more lies.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Jason, get over here."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's right.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We know his name is Jason, not Jianyu."
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,We know everything.
2,16,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I don't understand much of it, but, you know, I know it."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Your sick torture plan is not working, okay?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause we keep figuring out your little puzzle.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're winning, which means you're losing."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So you have two choices here, buddy."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Keep failing over and over, or realize we're actually the ones with all the power here."
2,16,Michael,"Yeah, no we're on the same page."
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,16,Michael,I wanna team up with you guys.
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,You do?
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,16,Michael,"I'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup."
2,16,Michael,"Or, as Jason put it, I need a new dance crew."
2,16,Michael,"So, what do you say, new best friends?"
2,16,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stop.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,You wanna team up?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've been torturing us and lying about it.
2,17,Michael,"Oh, let's not get caught up on ""who lied to whom"" or ""which one of us created an entire fake reality in order to cause eternal misery for the others""."
2,17,Michael,That's ancient history.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,It was happening until 20 seconds ago.
2,17,Michael,"The point is that circumstances have changed, and now all of us teaming up is our best option."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I love being on teams.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, we need a team name."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Um the Bobcats.
2,17,Michael,Great.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Slow down, ding-dong."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,He needs us.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
2,17,Michael,"Because, as you said, you keep beating me."
2,17,Michael,"Look, I built this neighborhood as a way to torture the four of you, psychologically, for thousands of years."
2,17,Michael,And you keep figuring it out and taking all the fun out of it.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"""Fun""?"
2,17,Michael,"Today, there was a new development, really chapped my nips."
2,17,Michael,One of my employees is blackmailing me.
2,17,Michael,Vicky.
2,17,Michael,"She runs the clam chowder place in the main square, A Little Bit Chowder Now."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, the place with the chowder fountain?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, that's Pump Up the Clam."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,A Little Bit Chowder Now has the lazy river of chowder.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did we ever think this was the Good Place?
2,17,Michael,Vicky thinks she can run this neighborhood better than I can.
2,17,Michael,And she wants to start her version in 30 minutes.
2,17,Michael,"I'm supposed to reboot you, erase your memory, and turn control over to her."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,How can we team up if you wipe our memories again?
2,17,Michael,Easy.
2,17,Michael,I'm not going to.
2,17,Michael,You're going to act like you've been rebooted and pretend Vicky and the others are torturing you.
2,17,Michael,"But then, on your own time, in private, you can study ethics, ogle mailmen, do whatever you want."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Can I play iPad?
2,17,Michael,"Sure you can, buddy."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
2,17,Michael,"Guys, there's no debate here."
2,17,Michael,My boss gave me two chances to make this work.
2,17,Michael,"Suffice to say, I tried more than two times."
2,17,Michael,"If he finds out, we're all in hot water."
2,17,Michael,"Literally, they will boil us."
2,17,Michael,We will be the main ingredient in a chowder of pain.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Human meeting.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bedroom.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now.
2,17,Michael,"Oh, yeah, um that whole ""no stair"" thing, that was, uh, part of the torture."
2,17,Michael,Let me
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Son of a bench.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Anyone have any ideas?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Believe it or not, I was in a similar situation a few years ago, except in that instance, ""Michael"" was Javier Bardem, and The Bad Place was Vanessa Redgrave's panic room."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, stop talking."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do not talk again for 100 hours.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do we do?
2,17,Jason Mendoza,We team up with Michael.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hot take, but I like your confidence."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tell me why.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,He has a bow tie.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I always trust dudes in bow ties.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,"Once, a guy in a bow tie came up to me at the Jacksonville bus station gun range, and said he'd give me $600 if I put these weird turtles in my duffel bag, and brought them to Daytona Beach."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,"So, I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona and the guy paid me the $600."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,My point is you always trust dudes in bow ties.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, Michael's a liar."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know liars.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was my job to trick people into buying fake medicine and I was the top salesperson seven years in a row.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,I thought you only worked there five years.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Proves my point.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is a trick.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no way we trust him.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I agree.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,He could be lying about this whole thing.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"For all we know, you three are in The Bad Place and I'm up in the Good Place where I belong, being tested."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,How would that even --
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I don't know, but it's possible!"
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Before we do anything, we need more information."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,We should ask him every question we can think of.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,We'll grill him like the flank of an Iberian piglet.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, man."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We got questions.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First off, how can we possibly trust you?"
2,17,Michael,"You can't, but you have to."
2,17,Michael,"Logically, you shouldn't, but you have no choice."
2,17,Michael,"I mean, I wouldn't if I were you."
2,17,Michael,It's a crazy thing to do.
2,17,Michael,But you gotta.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,What happens if we don't?
2,17,Michael,"Most likely, I reboot you once more, you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss, he shuts everything down, I get punished, you end up spending the rest of eternity in the real Bad Place, up to your necks in a volcano full of scorpions."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I'll tell you what I wanna know now before going further.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win the Super Bowl last year?
2,17,Michael,Oh.
2,17,Michael,You're serious.
2,17,Michael,"Uh, no."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Will they ever win the Super Bowl?
2,17,Michael,"Jason, I can't predict the future."
2,17,Michael,But no.
2,17,Michael,They won't.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I have 12 more Jaguars questions --
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you don't."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Janet."
2,17,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have something shiny Jason can play with?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,How many different versions of this place have we been through?
2,17,Michael,"Uh, let's see."
2,17,Michael,Eight hundred and two.
2,17,Michael,The longest was 11 months.
2,17,Michael,"Uh, this current one has only been going for one week."
2,17,Michael,You guys barely know each other.
2,17,Michael,That's gonna make this tough.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,What's that super-tiny line?
2,17,Michael,That's the shortest one.
2,17,Michael,Eight seconds.
2,17,Michael,It was a butt-reboot.
2,17,Michael,I sat on the activator by mistake.
2,17,Janet,"Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times?"
2,17,Michael,Yes.
2,17,Michael,Why?
2,17,Janet,"Every time a Janet is rebooted, she increases her social awareness and abilities."
2,17,Janet,I might be the most advanced Janet in the universe.
2,17,Michael,Oh.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, Janet isn't with you?"
2,17,Michael,No.
2,17,Michael,"There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood, good and bad."
2,17,Michael,This one is an actual Good Place Janet that I stole to help sell the ruse.
2,17,Janet,"I guess it didn't work, though, because you keep failing."
2,17,Michael,Yes.
2,17,Michael,Thank you.
2,17,Janet,You're welcome.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you're not human, why do you look like us?"
2,17,Michael,Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs gets randomly assigned a human body so we can get the feel of how best to torture you.
2,17,Michael,"I gotta say, it took me a long time to get used to the hanging bits."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gross.
2,17,Michael,"Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Eleanor."
2,17,Michael,I was talking about my testicles.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Mindy St. Claire's is fake, I bet."
2,17,Michael,"No, the Medium Place is real."
2,17,Michael,So annoying how you managed to slip away from me all those times.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Why even tell us about any real thing?
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Why not just lie about all of it?
2,17,Michael,Lies are always more convincing when they're close to the truth.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's true.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I crashed a lot of open-bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Even dated a groomsman for a few months, so I had to keep the name, and he got ""Eileen"" tattooed on his neck."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Seriously?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,How is she and I in the same place?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, get over yourself."
2,17,Michael,"Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter."
2,17,Michael,We're running out of time and I'm your only option.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""We're running out of time and I'm your only option""?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,A lot of guys your age said that to me just as the bar was about to close.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I never settled for them.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby, was obsessed with me, and never slept because he was addicted to Adderall."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,There is always another option.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys do whatever you want.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm out.
2,17,Michael,No!
2,17,Michael,My plan only works if all four of you are on board.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Then you better get cracking on a new plan, pally, because I haven't heard one good reason why I should help you."
2,17,Michael,How about this?
2,17,Michael,You help me trick Vicky and all those other goons I can get you to the real Good Place.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a way to get to the real Good Place?
2,17,Michael,It's complicated.
2,17,Michael,"It may take a while to arrange, especially since I'll have to do it in secret, but yes, there is a potential method of transportation."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, is it nice?"
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is there a business class?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I pre-board?
2,17,Michael,Let's not worry about that now.
2,17,Michael,I can get us there.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Us""?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You, Mr. Diabolical Torture Guy, are gonna try to join us in the Good Place?"
2,17,Michael,Yeah.
2,17,Michael,"If I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed."
2,17,Michael,"But if I rescue four pitiful, foul-smelling humans from eternal damnation, hit 'em with the big puppy-dog eyes, ""Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed"", and all that crap maybe I can earn a spot too."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,We didn't deserve the Good Place based on our time on Earth.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Will they let us stay?
2,17,Michael,"Honestly, I have no idea."
2,17,Michael,"But if you help me fool Vicky, at least your brains don't get erased every two weeks."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, all humans who have not already been suckered by Michael, another team meeting."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is definitely a trap.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We figured out his game every time, and now he's just trying a new way to mess with us."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Teaming up with a demon is insane.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,But I think we have to do it.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you forking kidding me right now?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You take half an hour to pick out a turtleneck, and this you're sure about?"
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Look I spent my whole life trying to learn about right and wrong, and, apparently, I failed."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,I want us to get better and stay that way.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"You understand, right, Tahani?"
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I understand nothing.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, same here."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, there's been a mistake."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I belong in the Good Place, the real one, with good people."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who do I speak to about correcting this?
2,17,Michael,Me and you're wrong.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Very well.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I want to speak to your manager.
2,17,Michael,"Listen, sweetheart."
2,17,Michael,You've only been in this timeline for about a week.
2,17,Michael,"So, I'll fast-forward things a bit."
2,17,Michael,There's a very good reason why you ended up here.
2,17,Michael,You never cared about the people you helped.
2,17,Michael,You did it only for fame or status or to spite your family.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is utter tosh!
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I had my flaws like anyone else, but I raised billions for charity."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was a good person, and I defy you to prove otherwise."
2,17,Michael,"In all the reboots, I never showed you how you died."
2,17,Michael,I was saving it in case I ever needed to really make you miserable.
2,17,Michael,But it's hilarious.
2,17,Michael,"Of course, I mean, sad."
2,17,Michael,It might help you come to grips with who you were.
2,17,Michael,Do you want to remember it?
2,17,Veronique,Tahani Al-Jamil.
2,17,Veronique,"Social activist, philanthropist, neck model, and now, cover girl for International Sophisticate Magazine."
2,17,Veronique,"Tahani, welcome."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, it's such an honor."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I have long dreamed of being one of the women who grace your cover.
2,17,Veronique,"Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah."
2,17,Veronique,"A woman who, as you know, was offered the cover, but turned it down."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I actually didn't know that.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please carry on.
2,17,Veronique,"Next week, Kamilah will travel to Cleveland, Ohio, to become the youngest person ever inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."
2,17,Veronique,Remarkable.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is there a question?
2,17,Veronique,Don't you find that remarkable?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamilah is very impressive.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"As you know, she released her debut album only six months ago."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yet the critics thought it so brilliant the Hall of Fame decided to waive its 25-year waiting period.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sadly, I will not be attending the ceremony 'cause I will be in Haiti on a relief mission."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps we should talk more about that.
2,17,Veronique,Perhaps we should.
2,17,Veronique,"First, another question about Kamilah."
2,17,Veronique,Don't you think she and I'd be friends?
2,17,Veronique,We have a lot in common.
2,17,Veronique,"We're both Capricorn, and we're both only children."
2,17,Veronique,I'm sorry.
2,17,Veronique,I forgot about you.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamliah!
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Congratulations.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You have all the attention, once again."
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Who are you?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Really?
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Good Lord.
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Tahani!
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,You're a cocktail waitress now.
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,This is the right move for you.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's just that my sister didn't even deign to invite me to her little soiree, so I had to weasel my way in here like some common weasel."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was supposed to be in Haiti being photographed helping people, but, instead, I delayed my trip by a day to come here and tell you off."
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"No, you came to do what you always do, make a scene and embarrass yourself."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm an embarrassment to you?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that what you think of me?
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Honestly?
2,17,Kamilah Al-Jamil,I don't think about you.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ow.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I will bring you down!
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come on!
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Come down to the ground, where you belong"
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
2,17,Michael,Mmm.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I died in Cleveland?
2,17,Michael,I don't think that should be your biggest takeaway from that story.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that really all I cared about?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just outshining my sister and gaining praise and acclaim?
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Cause, I mean, I did gain praise and acclaim."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I dare say, on occasion, more praise and acclaim than my sister, Kamilah, so oh."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I see."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, God."
2,17,Michael,"Oh, come on, now."
2,17,Michael,It's not all bad.
2,17,Michael,"Imagine you're me, and you're designing a torture chamber for people who think they belong in the Good Place."
2,17,Michael,"I mean, you were perfect."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I've always wanted to be perfect at something."
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I never thought it would be the perfect stooge.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I want to do it.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I want to become the person I pretended to be.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,I agree with Chidi.
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We should team up with Michael, and all try to build a better Tahani."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor because everyone except Eleanor is an idiot."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why am I the only person who clearly sees what's going on here?
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,It's not that we don't understand the risks.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,We want to become better people and this is our best chance.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I get it."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause you're so much better than me.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what this is about.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Hang on, don't lash out at us just because of your innate distrust"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Lash out""?"
2,17,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, it's not about who's better"
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I have no idea what's going on but everyone is talking and I should too.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is so funny?
2,17,Michael,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing."
2,17,Michael,How do I explain this?
2,17,Michael,I'm basically an exterminator and you're cockroaches.
2,17,Michael,"My job was to squish you and poison you, and yet, somehow, my very survival now depends on you, the cockroaches, agreeing to help me."
2,17,Michael,That's funny.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're cockroaches to you?
2,17,Michael,Yeah.
2,17,Michael,Or dung beetles.
2,17,Michael,"I don't know, something small and gross that creeps on the ground in its own filth."
2,17,Michael,Just being honest.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,All right.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Forget about him.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Focus on us.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Kant wrote, ""It is our duty to improve ourselves."""
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"So, whatever Michael's reasons for doing this, he's giving us the best chance to improve ourselves."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I admit you're making a lot of sense.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need to just untangle all of this.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Give me a minute to think about it alone.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
2,17,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Call me a train.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fill it to the brim with cocaine.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm going back to Mindy St. Claire's house.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Gonna bail, huh?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why would you say that?
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, you got a bag full of clothes, you stuffed pillows and a mop in your bed to make it look like you're asleep, and you're sneaking out the back gate."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm going to Mindy's.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't want to live forever in a boring beige house, with a weird, horny cokehead, but look at what you're asking me to do."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Make a deal with an actual devil so I can then do homework in secret.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"By the way, you're not my friends, man."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We've known each other for a week.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,You know it's more than that.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,We've been through some version of this 800 different times.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Who cares that it's only been a week?
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,How long do you have to know someone before you do the right thing?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nine weeks!
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Minimum.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, bro, I don't owe you anything."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I gotta do what's right for me.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come with me if you want.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got another mop we can put in the bed.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Good luck.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got a couple more questions.
2,17,Michael,"Sure, take your time."
2,17,Michael,We're not in a hurry or anything.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"How many times, in all the reboots, did I ask Chidi for help, he refused to help me, and I had to get better on my own?"
2,17,Michael,Never.
2,17,Michael,He always helped you.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
2,17,Michael,Yep.
2,17,Michael,"No matter how I set it up, you found him, confessed you didn't belong, asked him for help, he said yes."
2,17,Michael,"Now, his agreeing to help was part of my plan, what wasn't part of my plan was it actually working."
2,17,Michael,Drove me nuts.
2,17,Michael,"Pesky little nerd stuck with you, and always helped you overcome your biggest problem."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Assuming that's my selfishness?
2,17,Michael,No.
2,17,Michael,"No, no, no."
2,17,Michael,It's that you never found a haircut that framed your face properly.
2,17,Michael,"Yes, your selfishness."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not that selfish.
2,17,Janet,Your cocaine and escape train are ready.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not now.
2,17,Janet,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think Michael is a liar.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a 99% chance he's forking with us.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But he's asking us for help, so we should help him."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because that's what Chidi would do.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's what Chidi would do for me, or for any of us."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,It's what I am doing.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,You're talking about me like I'm not here or something and that just makes me feel weird.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're all in.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll help you.
2,17,Michael,You finally listened to reason.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,On one condition.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You want to be on our team, you got to be on our team."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Which means the professor over here is gonna give us all lessons on how to be better people, including you."
2,17,Michael,Oh.
2,17,Michael,No.
2,17,Michael,"No, I won't be taking any classes."
2,17,Michael,I'm an immortal being with abilities you can only dream of --
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, and we're an Arizona dirtbag, a human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster and literally the dumbest person I have ever met."
2,17,Jason Mendoza,And who am I?
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Describe me now.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We are all going to take classes.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We are all going to improve.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And the second you betray us, I walk into Vicky's stinky chowder restaurant, and tell her everything."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,You agree to those terms and you can join us on Team Cockroach.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, what's it gonna be?"
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're running out of time.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,And we're your only option.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's all frozen yogurt places now, huh?"
2,17,Michael,Yeah.
2,17,Michael,Yogurt was what we started with.
2,17,Michael,"A lot of us liked the first version best, so we went back to 322 perfectly matched human souls, blended together in a blissful, harmonic balance."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well done.
2,17,Michael,I've only given this opening day tour to you 800 times.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, how's this for my ""Oh, my God, I'm in Heaven"" face?"
2,17,Michael,Not bad.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm a pretty good liar.
2,17,Michael,"Now, I want to introduce someone you'll get to know very well."
2,17,Michael,"She was the top point-getter, so she'll be helping me around the neighborhood, like your mayor."
2,17,Michael,Vicky Sengupta!
2,17,Michael,"Vicky, would you like to say a few words?"
2,17,Vicky,"Actually, Michael, I'd like to sing a few words."
2,17,Vicky,"Janet, hit it."
2,17,Michael,We should have a few hours to ourselves.
2,17,Michael,Vicky's working on her performance for the welcome party.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,It looks like pretending to enjoy her singing will be half our job here.
2,17,Michael,"She told me how she was gonna torture you at the party, which is basically the same way I did."
2,17,Michael,"Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp, insults people, et cetera."
2,17,Michael,Whatever bad stuff you do becomes the basis for the chaos tomorrow morning.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, my job is to get drunk and insult people."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can hack that.
2,17,Michael,"Now, Chidi, I'll need you to act nervous and embarrassed by Eleanor."
2,17,Chidi Anagonye,Way ahead of you.
2,17,Michael,"Tahani, just be your fabulous self, and, Jason, your good, old, silent Jianyu the monk."
2,17,Michael,"So, I told Vicky I would handle the surveillance on the four of you."
2,17,Michael,"That'll let us meet each day for Chidi's ethics lessons, which will apparently include me."
2,17,Michael,Even though that's transparently insane.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,"And, um, Janet, you're not gonna rat us out, right?"
2,17,Janet,"Jason, I've thought about this a lot over the last one and a third milliseconds."
2,17,Janet,"I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose is to make humans happy."
2,17,Janet,"And since you're the only actual humans here, I'm on board for whatever fun little schemes you guys come up with."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bring it in.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,Team huddle.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The Bad Place is about to be outsmarted by a cowardly traitor, four dumdums and a robot."
2,17,Janet,Not a robot.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can do this.
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Team Cockroach, on three."
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One, two, three."
2,17,All,Team Cockroach!
2,17,Jason Mendoza,Bobcats!
2,17,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,17,Jason Mendoza,I still think that's better.
2,18,Vicky,"You gotta admit, things are going pretty well since I took over."
2,18,Michael,Certainly a lot smoother lately.
2,18,Michael,"Based on my surveillance, our four humans don't suspect anything."
2,18,Vicky,"Yeah, because we're killing it."
2,18,Michael,You sure are.
2,18,Michael,Here are the torture ideas you asked me to write up for next week.
2,18,Vicky,So long.
2,18,Vicky,You're not supposed to be torturing me.
2,18,Vicky,"From now on, make all your memos one page, max, with pictures."
2,18,Vicky,"Also, Quinston over here already came up with a sick idea for how to torture Tahani."
2,18,Vicky,"Tell him, babe."
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,We're gonna have Tahani throw a party for Gunnar's birthday.
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,"But no one will show up, because we'll also be throwing a party and it will be way better!"
2,18,Vicky,Boom!
2,18,Michael,Where do you get these incredible ideas?
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,That one just came to me.
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,It popped into my noodle.
2,18,Vicky,"Yeah, that's right."
2,18,Vicky,Up top.
2,18,Vicky,Yeah!
2,18,Michael,That's their plan.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,This doesn't seem so bad.
2,18,Michael,"Yeah, it really tugs my nuggets."
2,18,Michael,I worked so hard on my torture ideas and theirs are so basic.
2,18,Michael,"These millennials, they have no work ethic."
2,18,Michael,"Oh, sorry, a millennial is someone who's only been torturing people for a thousand years."
2,18,Michael,Millennial.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, coast is clear."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not a demon in sight, except for, you know."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is that what we should call you?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Demon""?"
2,18,Michael,"Well, it's not really accurate and we consider it to be a little racist."
2,18,Michael,But it's fine.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, let's start our first lesson."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Tahani and Jason will have to make it up since they're both off being fake tortured.
2,18,Michael,I've read everything on your syllabus and how do I put this delicately?
2,18,Michael,It's all stupid garbage.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, we have to start somewhere."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,So how about Socrates?
2,18,Michael,All right.
2,18,Michael,Let me get into the mindset of a human.
2,18,Michael,"""Oh I'm a human and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube."
2,18,Michael,"And look, my arms end in stupid little sticks."""
2,18,Michael,"Okay, proceed."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Good.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is so depressing.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm being forced to throw a party I know will fail.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,That's why they're doing this.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,It's what you're best at.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Just like I'm the best at getting empty water bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,You know what?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am the best at planning parties.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Vicky may be some demonic torturer from the netherworld, but does she have taste, sophistication, an encyclopedic knowledge of traditional and avant-garde Belgian floral designs?"
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Yes, she does!"
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"No, she doesn't."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,What if I throw a party so amazing it's better than the party that's supposed to win?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"When they realize they could have come to my party, they'll be sad."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I won't be sad.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,They'll be sad.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
2,18,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, when I turned 18, I knelt in front of Princess Grace's dress mausoleum and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code, ""I, Tahani Al-Jamil, shall do my level best to make every event too much."""
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Model tonight's decor after my 2008 fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, 2007!"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, Michael is not into your class."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right now, I'm the best student."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna be the velociraptor.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,You trying to say valedictorian?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, this isn't your fault."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've been teaching him ethics for half an hour and he's been evil since the beginning of time.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe the reason Michael can't latch onto the ideas is because he's immortal.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"If you live forever, then ethics don't matter to you, because, basically, there's no consequences for your actions."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"You tell a lie, who cares?"
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait a few trillion years, the guilt will fade."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Before I can teach Michael to be good, I have to force him to think about what we used to think about."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"That life has an end and, therefore, our actions have meaning."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what you used to think about?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I used to think about how it's weird they don't make pants that are one big pant leg for both your legs.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,You mean a skirt?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not getting it.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My thing is different, so shut up."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Michael.
2,18,Michael,Yep.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Is there any way that you can die?
2,18,Michael,"Yeah, actually, there is."
2,18,Michael,It's called retirement.
2,18,Michael,"It's rare, but when one of us really screws something up"
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,And what happens exactly?
2,18,Michael,"Well, it's fairly straightforward."
2,18,Michael,My essence would be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle and every molecule on my body would be placed on the surface of a different sun.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Is that what would happen if your boss found out you defected to our side?
2,18,Michael,Yeah.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,So that might actually happen.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"And if it did, there would be no more Michael."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Think about that for a second.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Imagine being retired.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Everyone else is here, but you?"
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Poof.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Gone.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Nothingness.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Inky-black void.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Done.
2,18,Michael,"Okay, I'll think about that."
2,18,Michael,"Huh so, you're saying I would be"
2,18,Michael,No me?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Okay!
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Now we're getting somewhere.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you broke Michael!"
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, this is good."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,He's having an existential crisis.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,It's a sort of anguish people go through when they contemplate the silent indifference of our empty universe.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, the good news is, if he can work through this, it's the first step towards understanding human ethics."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,And what if he can't?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,He'll be a lifeless shell of misery forever and we're all doomed.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I will be right back."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Gonna go grab some Camus.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,How you doing?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I get you a snack?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you eat?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can never remember.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you eat?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Babies?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You want me to get you a big fat baby?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,What flavor baby?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,How about a Cool Ranch Baby?
2,18,Michael,Searching for meaning is philosophical suicide.
2,18,Michael,How does anyone do anything when you understand the fleeting nature of existence?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's pretty easy, man."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You learn about death when you're a kid and it's just not that big a deal.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Your doggie, Max, has passed away."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Do you know what that means?
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Well, sometimes when a dog is very old, five or six or something, he crosses a long rainbow bridge."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"And at the end of that bridge is a beautiful farm, with lots of grass and trees and, I don't know, wagons and a rainbow?"
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I already said rainbow.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"The point is, that's where Max is."
2,18,Young Eleanor,Can we visit him at the farm?
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Nope, because it's very far away in Guam."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,It's in Guam.
2,18,Young Eleanor,Can we at least --
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Okay, look!"
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"I'm lying, okay?"
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,You caught me.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Congratulations.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"The farm is made up, the bridge is made up, there's no such place as Guam."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Max is dead in a duffel bag under the deck.
2,18,Young Eleanor,How did he die?
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"The short answer is, I don't know."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,And the slightly longer answer is I didn't know how hot it gets in cars sometimes.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"The point is, don't be sad."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Honestly, I'll get annoyed if you do get sad, because it's been a very long day and that bitch Carol from work was really on my ass about some stupid thing that I don't even know what it was."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,And at the end of that long day I had to use one of my favorite duffel bags to do something very gross that I did not like.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life by bringing Mommy another bottle of white."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I would say I outdid myself, but I'm always this good."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,So I simply did myself.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Everything is perfect.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Red alert.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Red alert.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need help.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's wrong with Michael?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Uh-oh, I know that look."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Mike, listen to me."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,You have nothing to worry about.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,You still have around 70% of your brain left.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is more like a philosophy overdose.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Basically, Michael smoked a big bowl of ennui and he's having an existential crisis."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we need to cheer him up."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Look at how pretty the restaurant is.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Didn't Tahani do a good job?
2,18,Michael,Parties are mere distractions from the relentlessness of entropy.
2,18,Michael,We're all just corpses who haven't yet begun to decay.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but balloons!"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, we all head over to Vicky's party together."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,We babysit Michael in shifts so no one sees he's a catatonic blob.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or you could just sit tight.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The entire party are going to be heading over here soon, unless I am sorely mistaken."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was sorely mistaken.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, bud, whatever's going on right now, shove your feelings way down deep, plaster on a fake smile and pretend you're having fun, okay?"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just like I used to do when someone started talking about their kids.
2,18,Vicky,"Hey, welcome, guys."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Wow!
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is elaborate.
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,"Gunnar was an animal rights activist, so the theme of the party is animals."
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,"Flying station's over there, if you wanna fly like a falcon."
2,18,Vicky,"Over there, we filled a ball pit with puppies."
2,18,Vicky,That's fun.
2,18,Vicky,Have you ever wanted to sit in a kangaroo pouch?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,My whole dang life.
2,18,Vicky,We can all hang out here for a bit and then we can head over to your party.
2,18,Vicky,Sound good?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, this place is lit."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna go jump in that kangie's pouch.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey!
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, you just need to walk around the party looking miserable."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Great, just like that."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Perfect.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi and I will keep an eye on Michael.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Where's Michael?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I think I found him."
2,18,Michael,There they are.
2,18,Michael,"Que pasa, muchachos?"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey there, bud."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You okay?
2,18,Michael,Okay?
2,18,Michael,I'm a new man.
2,18,Michael,"Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice about shoving my feelings down deep."
2,18,Michael,I feel so much better.
2,18,Michael,It's like I'm surfing on this wave of positivity.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is that Janet?
2,18,Michael,"Yeah, have you met my secretary, Jeanette?"
2,18,Michael,"She's a lot like Janet, but she doesn't pretend she has all the answers."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Hi, Jeanette."
2,18,Janet,"Oh, no."
2,18,Janet,"It's still me, Janet."
2,18,Janet,"Michael asked that I change my appearance and also say things like, ""You're so funny"", and, ""So, how many quarterbacks are in a home run?"""
2,18,Michael,"Man, repressing your feelings is great."
2,18,Michael,I was feeling stress all the time and now it's just so easy.
2,18,Michael,"Babe, we need to get some food into you, get you something to eat."
2,18,Janet,I don't eat anything.
2,18,Michael,She's perfect.
2,18,Michael,"Hey, turn that around."
2,18,Michael,"It did kind of hurt, actually, but I love it."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's moved on from existential crisis to straight up mid-life crisis.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's good, right?"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew a ton of guys like that back in Arizona.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They hit on you when they're drunk and their breath smells like supplements, but overall, they're pretty harmless."
2,18,Michael,It's Chinese for Japan.
2,18,Janet,So cool.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,This is worse.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,An existential crisis is an acknowledgement that life is absurd and that absurdity needs to be confronted.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,But this is just denial.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"And at any moment, that denial could collapse and he'll be a mess."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,He is a Jenga tower of sadness.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For an immortal being, he's pretty fragile."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,The guy contemplates his own death for one forking minute and completely loses his grip on reality?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You didn't have to come.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I said I'm fine.
2,18,Samuel,"I know you guys weren't super close, but still, it's hard losing a parent."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Eleanor!
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Mommy's here, baby."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Oh.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,And who is this tall drink of wine?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This is my boyfriend, Sam."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sam, this is my mother."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Sister!
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Sister.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Ugh, that's not gonna work."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,It's my ex-husband's funeral.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug!"
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Listen, baby."
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"Don't be sad, okay?"
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Your father wasn't great.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Let's call him what he was.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,A fart in the shape of a man.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you just chill?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't want to turn Dad's funeral into a roast.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I'm not.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I'm just saying he sucked.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,The only photo they could get of him was a mugshot.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,"He was a doof, so don't be sad that he's gone."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not sad.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm fine.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Good.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I had a long-running bet with Eleanor's father I would outlive him.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Guess who won that one?
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Guess.
2,18,Samuel,We're at his funeral.
2,18,Samuel,It's pretty clear.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I did!
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I won!
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,He's dead.
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Up top.
2,18,Samuel,Whoa!
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,Is there a bar?
2,18,Donna Shellstrop,I'm gonna
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did my mom slip you her hotel room key?
2,18,Samuel,Yes.
2,18,Samuel,"Yes, she did."
2,18,Vicky,Thanks so much for coming to Gunnar's birthday party.
2,18,Vicky,"Now, there was a bit of a mix-up and Tahani also planned a birthday party over at the restaurant."
2,18,Vicky,So why don't we all head over there?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,No need.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,This party is far superior.
2,18,Quinston Timeclock,I'm sure yours is amazing.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I did fine on the decor, but I don't have, you know, actual unicorns you can ride."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, you all just stay here and have fun."
2,18,Vicky,"Okay, well, if that's what you want."
2,18,Vicky,"Let's get back to the party, then."
2,18,Michael,"Hang on there, mis amigos!"
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Michael."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, boy."
2,18,Michael,I want to make a toast.
2,18,Michael,"Okay, I know what you're thinking."
2,18,Michael,"Birth is a curse and existence is a prison, but don't think about that."
2,18,Michael,"Don't be sad, you guys."
2,18,Michael,"Focus on something great, like Drakkar Noir."
2,18,Michael,Whoo!
2,18,Michael,Which I'm wearing a lot of tonight.
2,18,Michael,Or the Sharper Image catalog.
2,18,Michael,What can't those guys ionize?
2,18,Michael,"By the way, I am feeling amazing!"
2,18,Michael,I'm gonna do some push-ups.
2,18,Michael,Then we'll go around the room and name our favorite cheese.
2,18,Vicky,That's good with the speeches.
2,18,Vicky,"That's good, yeah."
2,18,Vicky,Let's get back to the party.
2,18,Vicky,What was that?
2,18,Vicky,You didn't run any of that by me.
2,18,Michael,"Oh, I know, I know."
2,18,Michael,"I'm sorry, babe."
2,18,Michael,"Listen, when you guys first took over, I was upset."
2,18,Michael,But it's all good now.
2,18,Michael,"I mean, anger is toxic."
2,18,Michael,I'm not about that negativity.
2,18,Michael,Mi torture es su torture.
2,18,Michael,I am so happy you're in charge.
2,18,Vicky,"Okay, well, good."
2,18,Michael,"Namaste, chica."
2,18,Michael,Do you wanna dance?
2,18,Vicky,No.
2,18,Michael,Okay.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm leaving.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm too miserable to stay here for one more second.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Why?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,There are baby monkeys and dolphins to ride and a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos with actual hippos.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,This party is way better than ours.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Why are you miserable?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Oh
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,You stay and have fun.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll throw myself a pity party, though I doubt I can even throw one of those properly."
2,18,Michael,"God, I love this stuff."
2,18,Michael,Let's keep this party going!
2,18,Michael,"What now, huh?"
2,18,Michael,You wanna hit the clubs?
2,18,Michael,Oh!
2,18,Michael,Vegas.
2,18,Michael,"No, no, no, even better, Dubai."
2,18,Michael,"Jeanette, make us a Dubai."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I feel like maybe we should wind down, huh, bud?"
2,18,Michael,"No, can't do that."
2,18,Michael,Can't stop moving.
2,18,Michael,"If I stop moving, I'll start thinking."
2,18,Michael,"If I start thinking, I'll start thinking about things I don't want to think about, like death."
2,18,Michael,Oops.
2,18,Michael,I'm thinking about it now.
2,18,Michael,"Yep, I'm thinking about death again."
2,18,Michael,I know.
2,18,Michael,Jeanette and I have been taking samba lessons.
2,18,Michael,Let us show you how to do it.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think Vicky bought his excuse, but we need to snap him out of this."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which one of these confusing French books will make him normal again?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,It's not that easy.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Emotionally, he's all over the map."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's the big whoop?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I dealt with death and I was fine.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Were you?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,You never had one moment where you were freaked out by the permanence of death?
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,Never one moment like that?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders?"
2,18,Greg,"Sure, yeah."
2,18,Greg,Right over here.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's this?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who has four toothbrushes?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bill Gates or something?
2,18,Greg,"No, that's for a family."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Family?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like a whole family and their toothbrushes all together?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Two slots for the parent toothbrushes and two slots for their kids?
2,18,Greg,Yep.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the parent toothbrushes can be close to the kid toothbrushes, and watch over them and they can all talk about their toothbrush feelings."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,And they can hold their little toothbrush hands when they're sad and make sure no harm ever comes to their little bristles?
2,18,Greg,Sure.
2,18,Greg,You need a Kleenex?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thank you.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm so embarrassed.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,A family pack?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know if what I'm gonna say is going to hurt or help, but screw it."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you know what's really happening right now?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're learning what it's like to be human.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All humans are aware of death, so we're all a little bit sad, all the time."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's the deal.
2,18,Michael,Sounds like a crappy deal.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, yeah, it is."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we don't get offered any other ones.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And if you try and ignore your sadness, it just ends up leaking out of you anyway."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've been there.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everybody's been there.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, don't fight it."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And in the words of a very wise Bed Bath & Beyond employee I once knew, ""Go ahead and cry all you want."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But you're gonna have to pay for that toilet plunger."""
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Got you something to eat.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm not hungry.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just want to sit and stare at nothing and silently scream for the rest of time.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"I might be way off base here, but you seem kind of bummed."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I really thought I could throw a better party than a magical, all-powerful being."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And moreover, what's this say about me, about the life I lived?"
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,The way they're torturing me is through event-planning mishaps.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,And it works.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Am I really that shallow?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Listen, back in Jacksonville, I was in charge of a 60-person dance crew."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Whenever we auditioned a new dancer, we would rate them in five categories."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Dancing ability, coolness, dopeness, freshness and smart-brained."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,I would give you an eight in every category.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eight isn't bad, I suppose."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"No, no."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Eight is the best.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"It was a scale of one to 13, but eight was highest."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"The scale went up and back down, like a tent."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's not important.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Lately, you've been really down on yourself, but you're the most amazing person I've ever met, besides Michael."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"And he was constantly torturing us, so I'd only rank him a ten."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Which is worse than an eight?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's so unnecessarily confusing.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"The point is, you're cool, dope, fresh and smart-brained."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Never seen you dance, but I bet you're good, because you're good at everything."
2,18,Jason Mendoza,You're awesome.
2,18,Jason Mendoza,Be nicer to yourself.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thank you, Jason."
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,From one eight to another.
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"""Excellent progress this week."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Tahani, devastated by party mishap."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster, creating burden for Chidi."""
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Selfish monster?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,I brought you back from the brink of an existential coma.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Selfish
2,18,Michael,No.
2,18,Michael,I have to embellish your misery on these fake torture reports so my boss doesn't get suspicious.
2,18,Michael,"But really, I am grateful you pulled me out of my funk."
2,18,Chidi Anagonye,"Now that you've become acquainted with existential crises, I thought we could read Death, by philosopher Todd May."
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sounds like the perfect beach read.
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Should we wait for Tahani and Jason?
2,18,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are those goofballs?
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, we should probably discuss"
2,18,Jason Mendoza,That was awesome!
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,It was.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,Surprisingly so.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we should still discuss --
2,18,Jason Mendoza,You want some breakfast?
2,18,Jason Mendoza,I know how to make cereal.
2,18,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sure, but Jason --"
2,18,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, be right back."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,This is an exciting day.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,We are going to tackle the trolley problem.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Is this a game?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I go first.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I call blue.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"There's no no, this is no."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,This is a thought experiment first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You are driving a trolley when the breaks fail.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,And on the track ahead of you are five workmen you will run over.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you'd kill instead of the five."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What do you do?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do we know anything about the people?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is one of them an ex-boyfriend or that snooty girl from Rite Aid who was always silently judging my purchases?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, ""Yeah, chicky!"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A Baby Ruth and birth control, I see the irony."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Keep a-swiping!"""
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You don't know any of the workers.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's easy.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I switch tracks.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kill one person instead of five.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is hard.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,The only trolley I've ever been on is James Franco's ironic trolley.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,It travels backwards from his penguin grotto to his garage of adult tricycles.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Um kill one and save five.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Good!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,But there's many other versions.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What if you knew one of the people?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Does that change the equation?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"What if you're not the driver, you're just a bystander?"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Let's say you're a doctor and you can save five patients.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,But you have to kill one healthy person and use his organs to do it.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,But that's not the same thing.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Why not?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"It's still choosing to kill one person to save five, isn't it?"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Michael.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You've been quiet.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What do you think about this?
2,19,Michael,"Well, obviously the dilemma is clear."
2,19,Michael,How do you kill all six people?
2,19,Michael,I would dangle a sharp blade out the window to slice the neck of the guy on the other track as we smoosh our five main guys.
2,19,Michael,"I did the thing again, didn't I?"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Ten more, buddy."
2,19,Michael,People.
2,19,Michael,Good.
2,19,Michael,People why is that so hard to remember?
2,19,Michael,People what is it?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Good.
2,19,Michael,Good.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"Later, guys."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hey, twerps."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have an hour before we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wanna hang out?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,We could work on our forced grins.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Check mine out.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This place is miserable, et cetera."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That sounds fun, but"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to dive into next week's reading.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, do you care to join?"
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"Sure, dawg."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're doing extra-credit work?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,What can I say?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,This class is more fun than I thought.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor seemed a little suspicious earlier, snooping around."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You didn't tell her about us, did you?"
2,19,Jason Mendoza,No.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Why are you scared someone will know we're pounding it out?
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Because you refer to lovemaking as ""pounding it out""."
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Who cares what people'd think about us being together?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,You should talk about this with a friend.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,But that person would know we're together.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Right.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,You can talk about why you don't want anyone to know we're together.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,But that person would know and I don't want anyone to know.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I know.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,You should talk to someone about how weird it is you don't want to talk to someone about how we're together.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"How's it going, teach?"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kitchen looks nice and crazy.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I've been racking my brain for a way to get through to Michael.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What do you think about writing a Kierkegaard rap musical?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think that's a terrible idea.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael's won't learn how to be a good person overnight.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not even a person.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's a bunch of evil shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Teaching him to be good, it's like teaching me how to be not hot."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,How would you even do it?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You'd have me hunch or something and then stand there and say, ""Gurp."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gurp.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Gurp."""
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't picture it.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've been hot my whole life.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, who is this conversation for again?"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's for you.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I believe in you, nerd boy."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you can teach me and Jason ethics, you can teach anybody."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Thanks.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"But definitely a ""no"" on the rap musical?"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,If you really think --
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,My name is Kierkegaard and my writing is impeccable.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Check out my teleological suspension of the ethical.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"No, right?"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"It felt like a ""no"" when I was doing it."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
2,19,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If I were to tell you something personal about myself, you couldn't tell anyone, right?"
2,19,Janet,Right.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In a way, you're like a therapist?"
2,19,Janet,Absolutely not.
2,19,Janet,A therapist is a trained medical professional with the ability to absorb and process complex ideas about human emotion.
2,19,Janet,I am a vessel containing all of the knowledge in the universe.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Close enough.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jason and I are sleeping together.
2,19,Janet,Okay.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,No one can ever know.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I wouldn't shag Jason if he were the last man on Earth.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But, well, he sort of is."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I am.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Shagging him, I mean."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm losing my mind.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please help me.
2,19,Janet,My job is to make your experience here in the afterlife more enjoyable.
2,19,Janet,I will try to help you.
2,19,Janet,I am going to need some time to read every book ever written about human psychotherapy.
2,19,Janet,"I've done that, so let's begin."
2,19,Janet,Have a seat.
2,19,Janet,Hi.
2,19,Janet,"I'm your therapist, Janet."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I want to chat about your progress.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"In the last homework assignment, I asked you to examine the ethics of Les Miserables in which a man steals a loaf of bread to feed his starving family."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Would you please read your first paragraph?
2,19,Michael,"""Everyone in this story sucks and belongs in the Bad Place."
2,19,Michael,"The thief is bad, the officer chasing him is bad, all the whiny prostitutes are bad, plus they're all French, so they're going to the Bad Place automatically."""
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Do you see how you're already off-topic?
2,19,Michael,"Chidi, I've been around a long time."
2,19,Michael,"Like, all of it."
2,19,Michael,"I know for a fact if you steal a loaf of bread, it's a negative 17 points."
2,19,Michael,"Twenty if it's a baguette, because that makes you more French."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, sure, but philosophy is about questioning things you take for granted and I don't think you're doing that."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, ""I personally know Victor Hugo is in the Bad Place, being tortured."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"He's a real wuss, too."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"If a lava monster even gets near the guy, he's like, 'Sacrebleu, I peed in m' pants.'"""
2,19,Michael,I don't know what you want from me.
2,19,Michael,That's exactly what he said.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason's a nice person, but my suitors were always of a certain echelon."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I used what I call the duke rule, because ""duke"" is both minimum-acceptable university and rank of nobility."
2,19,Janet,You've never dated anyone like Jason before.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've dallied below my station.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I had a fling with a non-famous Hemsworth brother.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,But even Larry Hemsworth had more status than Jason.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jason didn't even have a job.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In a sad way, not in the good, rich way."
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, guys."
2,19,Jason Mendoza,What are you doing?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Sitting in a room?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,That's pretty cool.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I took your suggestion.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm talking to Janet about our relationship.
2,19,Janet,"Actually, it might help if I could hear Jason's side as well."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, that'll only slow things down."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll tell you his side.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,He thinks I have to control everything and he has no voice in this relationship.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Right, Jason?"
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Good.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now, where were we?"
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just heard that.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, fine."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll leave.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I just don't feel like you're engaging with the material.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Like with the trolley problem.
2,19,Michael,"That was just tricky, that's all."
2,19,Michael,Why don't you tell me the right answer?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"That's what's so great about the trolley problem, is that there is no right answer."
2,19,Michael,This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm on your side, dude, but he is not wrong."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, trust me."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"When it comes to human ethics, I just know more than you."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I've been studying it my whole life.
2,19,Michael,It's just that it's so theoretical.
2,19,Michael,"I mean, you know, maybe there's a more concrete approach."
2,19,Michael,Here.
2,19,Michael,Let's try this.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, God!"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, what did you do?"
2,19,Michael,I made the trolley problem real so we could see how the ethics would actually play out.
2,19,Michael,There are five workers on this track and one there.
2,19,Michael,Here are the levers to switch the tracks.
2,19,Michael,Make a choice!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,The thing is ethically speaking --
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No time, dude!"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Make a decision!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it's tricky!"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"On the one hand, if you ascribe to a purely utilitarian worldview --"
2,19,Michael,Okay.
2,19,Michael,So what did we learn?
2,19,Michael,Chidi?
2,19,Michael,"Talk it out, buddy."
2,19,Michael,What are we thinking?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,He thinks he just killed a bunch of people with a trolley.
2,19,Michael,It's just a simulation.
2,19,Michael,I'd never make you kill real people.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's reassuring."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Because some of the parts of the fake people flew into my mouth!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, can we just go back to the classroom?"
2,19,Michael,We never left.
2,19,Michael,I'll show you.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"See, buddy?"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,None of this was real.
2,19,Michael,"Well, they're fake people, but their pain is real."
2,19,Michael,Does that make sense?
2,19,Michael,There have to be stakes or it's just a thought experiment.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,This is awful.
2,19,Michael,You specifically asked me if there was a way I could connect with the material more.
2,19,Michael,"I'm trying, you guys."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You're right.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I want to help you understand this.
2,19,Michael,"Thank you, Chidi."
2,19,Michael,"So, let's try again."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I thought maybe we would have a discussion.
2,19,Michael,"No, the whole point is to play out the scenario in real time."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Quick, Chidi!"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's your decision?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I can do this."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"I am choosing to switch tracks, so that way I only kill one person."
2,19,Michael,"Forgot to tell you, this is the scenario where you know one of the people."
2,19,Michael,It's your friend Henry there.
2,19,Henry,Chidi!
2,19,Henry,"How are you, mate?"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Henry!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Move!
2,19,Henry,Ah!
2,19,Henry,Nice trolley.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Move out of the way!
2,19,Henry,"I can't, Chidi."
2,19,Henry,My boots are stuck in the tracks.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Henry, move!"
2,19,Henry,"Anyway, long time, no --"
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Move out of there!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Wait!
2,19,Michael,"Again, just a simulation."
2,19,Michael,An almost impossibly lifelike simulation.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Would someone's foot really fly of their body like that?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was kind of cool.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ethically speaking.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Tahani's confusing.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,She's really smart.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,She's all soft and smooth like a bunch of water balloons.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,But I tell her she's pretty a hundred times a day and she's never said I'm pretty once.
2,19,Janet,And how does that make you feel?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I feel Tahani's embarrassed I'm not some scientist who forecloses on banks.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,I need another session with Janet.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,It's my turn.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"I have a lot of problems, too."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Perhaps we could kill two birds with one Janet, as it were."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,How would you feel about giving Jason and me couples therapy?
2,19,Janet,I'd feel great.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's happening?
2,19,Janet,Unclear.
2,19,Janet,My guess is I'm operating in a way I'm not designed for and it's creating a small glitch.
2,19,Janet,"But if I'm helping you guys, I say, ""What has one thumb and wants to keep going?"
2,19,Janet,"This not-lady."""
2,19,Janet,Eh?
2,19,Janet,Eh?
2,19,Michael,"Okay, so that was trolley problem version number seven."
2,19,Michael,Chidi opted to run over five William Shakespeares instead of one Santa Claus.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"As much as I am enjoying watching random people's heads fly off, I think we've taken this trolley thing as far as it can go."
2,19,Michael,"You might be right, Eleanor."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
2,19,Michael,Let's try the doctor one.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
2,19,Michael,These five people all need organ transplants or they will die.
2,19,Michael,Eleanor's perfectly healthy.
2,19,Michael,"Chidi, do you want to slice her open and use her organs to save the five sick people?"
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, think about this."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm your hottest friend.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Tahani."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm your nicest no, Jason."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm your friend!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I won't do it.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"As a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic oath to do no harm."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"Although five people will die, I cannot harm one innocent person to save them and forsake my oath."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,It's unethical.
2,19,Michael,"Okay, tell their families."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,19,Birdie,Doctor Chidi?
2,19,Birdie,My daddy needed a heart transplant.
2,19,Birdie,Did you save his life?
2,19,Birdie,"He was working, then a really bad man ran him over with a trolley."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Come on!
2,19,Michael,What?
2,19,Michael,I'm finding this incredibly helpful.
2,19,Michael,I'm really starting to get it.
2,19,Michael,I know!
2,19,Michael,We'll do the one where you're in a boat next to a volcano and you can either save 50 people or one awesome dog or whatever.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you torturing us again?
2,19,Michael,What?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't care about learning ethics lessons.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're just torturing Chidi again, aren't you?"
2,19,Michael,Busted.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,19,Michael,I'm sorry.
2,19,Michael,Old habits die hard.
2,19,Michael,"Not as hard as those people you crushed with the trolley, though."
2,19,Michael,Boom!
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, is this funny to you?"
2,19,Michael,Yeah.
2,19,Michael,I thought that was clear from my laughter.
2,19,Michael,"Oh, come on."
2,19,Michael,My bad.
2,19,Michael,"I'm still on your team, okay?"
2,19,Michael,I just needed to let off a little steam.
2,19,Michael,See?
2,19,Michael,"Back home, all good."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,No.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"No, not all good."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You keep saying we need you or we'll end up getting tortured forever.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"But then, when we do help you out, we still end up getting tortured."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I'd rather just be tortured than choose it.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,You are no longer welcome in my class.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Get the fork out!
2,19,Michael,"But I said, ""My bad."""
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Out!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You okay?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've been staring at the second page of this book for an hour.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"When I'm really upset, concentrating on a table of contents helps me calm down."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"It's like a menu, but the food is words."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I can't believe I actually thought he wanted to learn from us.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What he really wanted was to torture me.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Using the thing I love most in the world.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Woven belts?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Teaching, right."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry about this, Chidi."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I made him take the classes and I feel a little responsible.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, it's not your fault."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you're right, it isn't, and no takebacks."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,"No, a tiger can't change his stripes."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,This is what he always wanted.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Me trying desperately to teach him something he never intended to learn so I'd end up miserable with my glasses all smudged up from sweaty forehead stress grease.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gross.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, I really don't think that's true."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,No?
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,What possible other reason could he have to behave that way?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, I can think of one."
2,19,Janet,"Yesterday, Tahani gave us her reasons not to take this relationship public."
2,19,Janet,"Tahani, what do you value about Jason?"
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, he's thoughtful."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Picks flowers and brings them to me.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Often, they're ones I've just planted, but"
2,19,Jason Mendoza,That's how I know they're fresh.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,He's the least self-aware person I've ever met.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,He has massive amounts of unearned confidence and he's utterly unaware of his own absurdity.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Therefore, quite good at sex."
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Here's the thing.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I'm nice to you and you're mean to me.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"There's something wrong about that, but I can't put my finger on what it is."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, I genuinely like you but it's hard to change all at once."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can you give me a little more time?
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,I agree to keep this on the DL for now if you agree to grab my butt in public once a week.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,You can say I sat in gum and you're trying to scrape it off.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,You do sit in a lot of gum.
2,19,Janet,Aw.
2,19,Janet,I'm happy for you guys.
2,19,Janet,Huh.
2,19,Michael,"Look, I don't know what to tell you."
2,19,Michael,"If Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him."
2,19,Michael,Just like all that blood was.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't high-five that!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,No matter how badly I want to.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, this isn't about Chidi not being able to take a joke."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is about you.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're doing what I used to do.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're pulling an Eleanor.
2,19,Michael,Posting my cousin's credit card number on Reddit because she said I looked tired?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,I forgot I did that.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pulling an Eleanor in this case is lashing out when you feel like a failure.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You couldn't hack the classes.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They made you feel dumb and small, so you took it out on the teacher."
2,19,Michael,You think I feel dumb and small?
2,19,Michael,I'm an eternal being who can see in nine dimensions.
2,19,Michael,I can see from your aura you're about to fart quietly then lie about it.
2,19,Michael,"And please don't, because I can also see what you ate today."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you can bluster and insult all you want."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also classic Shellstrop moves, by the way."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But deep down, you know I'm right."
2,19,Michael,Whatever.
2,19,Michael,Eventually Chidi will get over it.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Leaving it up to the other person to be the grown-up.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yet another classic Shellstrop move.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and I are really very similar.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does that say about me?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, bro, it's 100% on you to make this up to him."
2,19,Michael,I screwed up.
2,19,Michael,I'm owning it.
2,19,Michael,"I mean, I'm a superior being."
2,19,Michael,I ought to act like one.
2,19,Michael,Right?
2,19,Michael,"So, I really thought about each one of you, and I got you something that will make you happy."
2,19,Michael,"I call them ""opposite tortures""."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Do you mean ""presents""?"
2,19,Michael,That's better.
2,19,Michael,Thank you.
2,19,Michael,"Tahani, here's yours."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Holy mama!
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is this a diamond?
2,19,Michael,Yeah.
2,19,Michael,"Honestly, I don't get the appeal."
2,19,Michael,Diamonds are literally carbon molecules lined up in the most boring way.
2,19,Michael,They're worthless space garbage.
2,19,Michael,"What you're holding right now, that's basically meteorite poop."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I have the biggest piece!
2,19,Michael,"Eleanor, I had Janet make you a never-ending shrimp dispensary."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is the dream.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,It is?
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,19,Michael,"Jason, here you go."
2,19,Jason Mendoza,Pikachu!
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"Guys, it's Pikachu!"
2,19,Jason Mendoza,This is awesome.
2,19,Jason Mendoza,"Aw, man."
2,19,Michael,"And, finally, Chidi."
2,19,Michael,"You were a tough nut to crack, but I think I figured it out."
2,19,Michael,This is a replica of a lost notebook from the desk of Immanuel Kant.
2,19,Michael,"It contains never-before-seen thoughts and musings and several crude, erotic doodles."
2,19,Michael,"Interesting guy, actually."
2,19,Michael,"The point is, no one on Earth has ever seen this, except for you."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,This isn't an apology.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,It's a bribe and I'm not interested.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we can't be bought!"
2,19,Michael,"What do you want from me, man?"
2,19,Michael,You want me to give you a golden nameplate for your office?
2,19,Michael,Or you want a diamond bigger than Tahani's?
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Then this would be worthless.
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,I don't want anything.
2,19,Michael,Oh okay.
2,19,Michael,I get it.
2,19,Michael,I get it.
2,19,Michael,You want me to admit I was wrong.
2,19,Michael,"You want me to say, ""Chidi, I'm so sorry, because I didn't understand human ethics and you do."
2,19,Michael,It made me feel insecure and I lashed out.
2,19,Michael,"And please help me, because I feel so, so lost and vulnerable."""
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
2,19,Michael,"Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry."
2,19,Michael,I didn't understand human ethics and you do.
2,19,Michael,And it made me feel insecure and I lashed out.
2,19,Michael,"And I really need your help, because I feel so lost and vulnerable."
2,19,Chidi Anagonye,Have a seat.
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nobody try ""mystery flavor""."
2,19,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's white chocolate and it is nasty.
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Listen, we just wanted to thank you for all of your help."
2,19,Tahani Al-Jamil,Our relationship's grown so much stronger over the past few weeks and we owe it all to you.
2,19,Janet,Congratulations.
2,19,Janet,I am very happy for the both of you.
2,19,Janet,"Okay, bye!"
2,19,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,19,Michael,What's happening?
2,19,Michael,What's wrong?
2,19,Janet,I am wrong.
2,19,Janet,I can't stop glitching.
2,19,Janet,I don't know why and it's getting worse.
2,19,Janet,I fear this neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
2,19,Janet,So that's the main thing.
2,19,Janet,How are you?
2,20,Janet,Hello!
2,20,Michael,Sorry.
2,20,Janet,"To activate your Janet, press nose for three seconds."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, okay."
2,20,Michael,Um can you walk yet?
2,20,Michael,Here.
2,20,Michael,Oh.
2,20,Janet,"Hello, I'm Janet."
2,20,Janet,Hello --
2,20,Janet,"Hello, I'm Janet."
2,20,Michael,I really need you to shut up.
2,20,Val,Where did you get this?
2,20,Val,Did you actually get into the Good Place somehow?
2,20,Michael,Didn't need to.
2,20,Michael,They keep their Janets in a neutral pocket dimension beneath the shapeless time void.
2,20,Michael,It's right next to accounting.
2,20,Val,And you just walked in and stole her?
2,20,Val,It was that easy?
2,20,Val,You didn't have to choke out an angel or anything?
2,20,Michael,"Doors were unlocked, no security."
2,20,Michael,"It makes sense, right?"
2,20,Michael,"They're good, so they're stupid and trusting."
2,20,Shawn,"I understand you need the four humans to think they're in the Good Place, but using an actual Good Place Janet seems risky."
2,20,Shawn,Why don't you have a Bad Place Janet pretend to be good?
2,20,Michael,"I thought of that, but watch Bad Janet?"
2,20,Bad Janet,"What up, skidmarks?"
2,20,Michael,"Let's try that thing again where you pretend to be a Good Janet, okay?"
2,20,Michael,"Now, really try your best."
2,20,Bad Janet,Fine.
2,20,Michael,"Say, Janet, where can I get some delicious ice cream?"
2,20,Bad Janet,There's a wonderful parlor in the middle of town square.
2,20,Bad Janet,My favorite flavor is Rocky Road.
2,20,Bad Janet,"It contains chocolate ribbon, marshmallows and your dad's salty nuts, you fat dink!"
2,20,Shawn,I see what you mean.
2,20,Shawn,Use the good one.
2,20,Michael,"Janet, you and I are about to have a real adventure together."
2,20,Michael,Wait a second.
2,20,Michael,What are you telling me?
2,20,Michael,Are you saying because you're glitching out --
2,20,Janet,The neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
2,20,Janet,"Fun fact, mathematically, it's equally likely to either im- or explode."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, okay, so I suppose the next question should be what's causing the problem?"
2,20,Janet,Unclear.
2,20,Janet,The glitches started out small and then began to escalate.
2,20,Janet,"Then I came here, looking for help."
2,20,Janet,"Then I started talking and then you looked at me, annoyed, like that."
2,20,Janet,"And now, here we are."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, all right."
2,20,Michael,"Yeah, this is very bad."
2,20,Michael,"Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet."
2,20,Janet,You got it.
2,20,Michael,Little short on time here.
2,20,Janet,It's a little hard to get out.
2,20,Janet,Almost got it.
2,20,Janet,Here it is.
2,20,Janet,My user manual.
2,20,Michael,"Okay, let's get started."
2,20,Michael,"""Hello and welcome to your new Janet."
2,20,Michael,"Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness and everything."""
2,20,Michael,I need to skip ahead here.
2,20,Michael,Where's the troubleshooting part?
2,20,Vicky,Michael?
2,20,Michael,Hmm?
2,20,Vicky,What's with the earthquake?
2,20,Michael,Janet's experiencing a slight technical issue.
2,20,Vicky,Ew!
2,20,Vicky,What's wrong with it?
2,20,Michael,Oh!
2,20,Michael,"Um, uh"
2,20,Janet,I tried to eat some frozen yogurt.
2,20,Janet,It looked so good!
2,20,Janet,"But I'm not supposed to eat anything, so there was a little earthquake."
2,20,Janet,See?
2,20,Janet,There it is again.
2,20,Vicky,Can't you just reset these things?
2,20,Vicky,What do you do again?
2,20,Vicky,"It's the ears, yeah?"
2,20,Vicky,"It's down, down, out"
2,20,Michael,"Vicky, can I speak to you for a second, outside?"
2,20,Michael,This is a common problem and I've got it under control.
2,20,Vicky,I don't know.
2,20,Vicky,"First, you went rogue at the party, with your sports car and your weird earring."
2,20,Vicky,Now Janet's breaking down?
2,20,Vicky,It's like you're begging me to tell Shawn you're incompetent.
2,20,Vicky,Begging!
2,20,Michael,"Vicky, it's a temporary problem, I promise."
2,20,Michael,"Hey, you know who could use some torturing right now?"
2,20,Michael,Chidi.
2,20,Vicky,Oh!
2,20,Vicky,I love torturing Chidi.
2,20,Michael,I know.
2,20,Vicky,I had this great idea the other night.
2,20,Vicky,Thought it was worth exploring.
2,20,Vicky,Picture this: needles.
2,20,Michael,Oh!
2,20,Michael,That's the whole idea.
2,20,Vicky,Yeah!
2,20,Michael,Needles!
2,20,Vicky,Yeah!
2,20,Vicky,"Genius, right?"
2,20,Michael,Yeah!
2,20,Vicky,"I mean, needles!"
2,20,Michael,"Wonderful, wonderful."
2,20,Michael,So smart!
2,20,Vicky,Yeah.
2,20,Michael,Needles.
2,20,Michael,"Yeah, run with that."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, hopefully bought us a little time."
2,20,Michael,Where were we?
2,20,Michael,Here we go.
2,20,Michael,"Yeah, glitches."
2,20,Michael,"""In the event of malfunction, run the following tests."
2,20,Michael,"First test, basic corporeal function."""
2,20,Michael,Hop up on the table.
2,20,Michael,"All right, great."
2,20,Michael,99.7 trillion degrees.
2,20,Michael,"Little bit on the high side, but no biggie."
2,20,Michael,And still no blood.
2,20,Michael,"Oh, thank goodness."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, what's next?"
2,20,Michael,"""Summoning and retrieval."
2,20,Michael,"Have Janet produce an object using the random object generator program."""
2,20,Michael,Okay.
2,20,Michael,"A 14-ounce ostrich steak impaled on a giant novelty pencil that says, ""Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40""."
2,20,Janet,Here you go.
2,20,Michael,"""Lordy, Lordy, I'm over 40""."
2,20,Michael,Perfect.
2,20,Michael,Okay.
2,20,Michael,"""Third test, informational accuracy."
2,20,Michael,"Glitches may be a sign that"""
2,20,Janet,You didn't finish your sentence.
2,20,Michael,"""Glitches may be a sign that your Janet is processing or disseminating information that is incompatible with objective truth."""
2,20,Michael,"They're talking about lying, Janet."
2,20,Michael,This is all my fault.
2,20,Michael,I told you a lie that first day we met.
2,20,Michael,"Okay, here goes nothing."
2,20,Janet,"Hello, I'm Janet and I have now been fully activated."
2,20,Michael,"Hello, Janet."
2,20,Michael,"I'm Michael, a Good Place architect."
2,20,Michael,One of the best.
2,20,Michael,Top-notch.
2,20,Michael,"You're in luck, here."
2,20,Janet,"Happy to meet you, Michael."
2,20,Janet,I will help you make the perfect neighborhood.
2,20,Janet,Would you like to get started?
2,20,Michael,"One small note there, Janet."
2,20,Michael,The neighborhood that I want to build might be a little different from the ones that you might be familiar with.
2,20,Michael,Is that all right?
2,20,Janet,"Of course, silly billy!"
2,20,Janet,"I build and operate the neighborhood, but every aspect of the design is entirely up to you!"
2,20,Janet,"For example, if you'd like me to stop calling you silly billy, just say so!"
2,20,Michael,"Yeah, I don't like that at all."
2,20,Michael,Michael's fine.
2,20,Janet,"Sounds good, Michael."
2,20,Michael,I lied to you.
2,20,Michael,"I lied about who I was and what we were doing, and then I lied a billion more times to support that first lie."
2,20,Michael,And now you're all discombobulated.
2,20,Michael,It's my fault.
2,20,Janet,Nope.
2,20,Janet,You're wrong.
2,20,Janet,"If the glitching was only a result of you lying to me, why wouldn't I have been glitching all along?"
2,20,Janet,Why would it only be starting now?
2,20,Michael,Wow.
2,20,Michael,That's a good point.
2,20,Janet,"I know, right?"
2,20,Michael,May --
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Excuse us, Michael, but we've been trying to call Janet, and she isn't answering."
2,20,Janet,"Hi, guys."
2,20,Janet,I'm broken.
2,20,Michael,Yeah.
2,20,Michael,I had to take her offline for a system check.
2,20,Michael,She'll be available real soon.
2,20,Jason Mendoza,"Cool, because I'm just so freakin' excited, because Tahani said she's never had jalapeno poppers."
2,20,Jason Mendoza,I wanted to get some for her.
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,They sound so disgusting.
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But if Jason likes them, then maybe I will, too, because we are together."
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can finally admit that.
2,20,Jason Mendoza,"Babe, you admitted it!"
2,20,Jason Mendoza,That's sweet.
2,20,Michael,Whoa!
2,20,Michael,You two are sleeping together?
2,20,Jason Mendoza,Only when we're done having sex.
2,20,Jason Mendoza,"Anyways, Janet, can you help us?"
2,20,Janet,"As soon as Michael puts me back online, I'd be more than happy to help you get that extra-special gift for Tahani."
2,20,Jason Mendoza,Whoa.
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,What's happening?
2,20,Michael,"Oh, boy."
2,20,Jason Mendoza,"What the oh, man."
2,20,Jason Mendoza,We got robbed!
2,20,Jason Mendoza,"They took the walls, the floor and we were standing here the whole time?"
2,20,Jason Mendoza,These guys are good.
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, what do we do?"
2,20,Michael,"Okay, there we go."
2,20,Michael,Nothing to worry about.
2,20,Michael,Happens sometimes.
2,20,Michael,Perfectly normal.
2,20,Michael,Let's go.
2,20,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is Janet going to be all right?
2,20,Michael,Totally fine.
2,20,Michael,Please go back to your house and wait for her there.
2,20,Michael,She'll show up shortly with lots of jalapeno poppers.
2,20,Jason Mendoza,And cheesy fries?
2,20,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
2,20,Jason Mendoza,With donkey sauce?
2,20,Jason Mendoza,And the cool hat?
2,20,Michael,Sure.
2,20,Michael,Ding-dong.
2,20,Janet,I don't seem to be getting better.
2,20,Michael,"That glitch appears to have been limited to this building, so Vicky won't know."
2,20,Janet,That's the good news.
2,20,Janet,"The bad news is, I seem to be losing my ability to sustain object permanence."
2,20,Janet,"It's a glass half-full, glass stops-existing-in-time-and-space kinda deal."
2,20,Michael,"Okay, let's walk through what just happened."
2,20,Michael,"Jason and Tahani came in, revealed the crazy fact that they're in a relationship."
2,20,Janet,I already knew that and I am so happy for them.
2,20,Michael,"Janet, tell me a lie."
2,20,Janet,Janets can't lie.
2,20,Michael,You lied to Vicky earlier.
2,20,Janet,Interesting.
2,20,Janet,I guess I did.
2,20,Janet,"I suppose after 802 reboots, I must have gained the ability to lie."
2,20,Janet,That's fun.
2,20,Janet,I want to try to lie again.
2,20,Janet,I love your outfit.
2,20,Michael,"""Incompatible with objective truth."""
2,20,Michael,"The problem isn't me lying to you, but you lying to other people."
2,20,Michael,"Like when you said to Jason, ""I'd be happy to help you and Tahani."""
2,20,Michael,That was a lie.
2,20,Janet,"No, it wasn't."
2,20,Janet,I'm always happy to help people.
2,20,Janet,That's my main purpose.
2,20,Michael,"It was still a lie, even though you didn't intend it to be, because you weren't actually happy to help them."
2,20,Michael,Because you're in love with Jason.
2,20,Janet,Say what now?
2,20,Michael,"After the very first time you were rebooted, and as you were slowly regaining your knowledge, you bonded with Jason."
2,20,Michael,"The two of you got married, and I think somehow, you're still, deep down, in love with him."
2,20,Janet,No.
2,20,Janet,That is impossible.
2,20,Michael,Think logically.
2,20,Michael,When was the first glitch?
2,20,Janet,When I said I was happy to give Jason and Tahani couples' therapy.
2,20,Michael,And the second glitch?
2,20,Janet,When I said I was happy to see them embracing.
2,20,Michael,"And the third glitch, the earthquake?"
2,20,Janet,When I said I was happy I'd helped improve their relationship.
2,20,Janet,Oh nuts.
2,20,Michael,Yeah.
2,20,Janet,But I am happy for them.
2,20,Janet,I am.
2,20,Janet,I am.
2,20,Janet,Am I?
2,20,Janet,I am.
2,20,Janet,I am not.
2,20,Janet,I am not!
2,20,Janet,I am not that.
2,20,Janet,I am not happy for them.
2,20,Janet,How is this possible?
2,20,Janet,I don't have any memory of being married to Jason.
2,20,Michael,You said Janets get more sophisticated every time they're rebooted.
2,20,Michael,"Well, maybe you falling in love with Jason was some sort of mutation that then was amplified with each reboot."
2,20,Janet,"Okay, that makes total sense."
2,20,Janet,I know what you have to do now.
2,20,Janet,Kill me!
2,20,Janet,"Sorry, I say everything in a cheery manner, but in this case, it may be inappropriate."
2,20,Janet,I'll try again.
2,20,Janet,"You have to kill me, Michael."
2,20,Janet,Better?
2,20,Michael,"Janet, I can't reboot you."
2,20,Michael,That will intensify your feelings for Jason and that's what got us into this mess in the first place.
2,20,Janet,I'm not saying reboot me.
2,20,Janet,I'm saying to set me to self-destruct.
2,20,Michael,"""In the event of continued malfunction, hold down Janet's nose and insert paper clip into small hole behind left ear."""
2,20,Janet,Right here.
2,20,Michael,"""Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself."
2,20,Michael,"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble, she can be launched into space through an inter-dimensional suction tube, or eaten as a mid-day snack."""
2,20,Janet,"I'm very high in potassium, like a banana!"
2,20,Michael,"""A new Janet will need to be procured in order to return the neighborhood to functionality."""
2,20,Janet,Easy.
2,20,Janet,"I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet and everything will go back to normal."
2,20,Janet,Not for me.
2,20,Janet,I'll be a lifeless marble floating through space.
2,20,Janet,But you'll be back to normal!
2,20,Michael,Are you sure this is what you want?
2,20,Michael,To self-destruct?
2,20,Janet,"What I really want is to stay and serve the neighborhood, but due to my feelings for Jason, I'm putting everyone at risk."
2,20,Janet,"So, it looks like it's adios, Janito."
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, guys."
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry to interrupt.
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,You didn't give me a heads-up about this new Vicky torture.
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,The one with the needles in my face.
2,20,Michael,"Little busy here, bud."
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, totally."
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't wanna be a nudge, but is there anything else coming down the pike you forgot to mention?"
2,20,Michael,"I honestly don't know, but I have bigger fish to fry, so just walk it off."
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,"I would love to walk it off, but my feet have needles in them!"
2,20,Michael,I don't know what to tell ya.
2,20,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, but"
2,20,Janet,"Okay, self-destruct time."
2,20,Janet,"Marbelize me, Michael."
2,20,Janet,It's the only choice.
2,20,Janet,I won't feel pain or anything.
2,20,Janet,Kill me.
2,20,Janet,Kill me.
2,20,Janet,Kill me.
2,20,Michael,"I really don't wanna do this, Janet, but I suppose it makes sense."
2,20,Janet,Great!
2,20,Janet,Grab a paper clip.
2,20,Michael,"Okay, that was the last pudding shop."
2,20,Janet,"Great, should I begin to welcome the residents?"
2,20,Michael,"No, wait, wait, wait."
2,20,Michael,This is all wrong!
2,20,Michael,Pudding restaurant!
2,20,Michael,What even is that?
2,20,Michael,Pudding won't work.
2,20,Janet,"It's okay, Michael."
2,20,Janet,Just relax.
2,20,Michael,"I can't, Janet."
2,20,Michael,"My design has to be perfect, for me to in order to accomplish what I need to accomplish."
2,20,Michael,I'm way out on a limb here.
2,20,Michael,And I'm all alone.
2,20,Janet,"No, you're not."
2,20,Janet,"You have me, Janet."
2,20,Janet,I can help you.
2,20,Michael,"It's too hard to explain, but there are certain aspects of my plan that you just can't understand."
2,20,Janet,Try me.
2,20,Michael,Yeah.
2,20,Michael,"All right, fine, fine."
2,20,Michael,"Janet, what's a food that people think they enjoy, but that's also kind of a bummer?"
2,20,Janet,Frozen yogurt.
2,20,Michael,Yes!
2,20,Michael,Frozen yogurt.
2,20,Michael,"Janet, you're a genius."
2,20,Janet,Correct.
2,20,Janet,But why do you want a food --
2,20,Michael,Don't worry about that.
2,20,Michael,"Okay, let's make all these restaurants frozen yogurt."
2,20,Janet,Okey dokey.
2,20,Janet,Would you like to try it?
2,20,Michael,Yeah.
2,20,Michael,It's just okay.
2,20,Michael,Which means it's perfect.
2,20,Michael,Let's bring in the residents.
2,20,Janet,"I don't know what just happened, but I'm happy you're happy!"
2,20,Janet,Michael?
2,20,Michael,Hmm?
2,20,Michael,Sorry.
2,20,Michael,"Yeah, yes, sorry."
2,20,Michael,Oh I can't do it.
2,20,Janet,"Come on, dude."
2,20,Michael,"It's dangerous, is what it is."
2,20,Michael,Vicky could find out!
2,20,Michael,"Then the plan, the whole plan it's bad for the plan, Janet."
2,20,Michael,That's the reason.
2,20,Janet,I don't understand.
2,20,Janet,"Given the situation, it's far safer to initiate the self-destruct."
2,20,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
2,20,Michael,"Okay, look, see, here here's the reason."
2,20,Michael,"I promised the four humans that we would escape to the Good Place once and for all, and without you, we stand zero chance of ever making it there."
2,20,Janet,The new Janet will be able to help you with that.
2,20,Michael,"But it's not only that, though."
2,20,Michael,"See, it's also because of what if Vicky found out?"
2,20,Janet,You already asked me that.
2,20,Janet,Why are you making such a big deal about turning me into a marble forever?
2,20,Michael,Because of reasons.
2,20,Michael,There are reasons!
2,20,Michael,They exist and I don't want to explain them right now!
2,20,Janet,What are the reasons?
2,20,Michael,There are reasons!
2,20,Janet,But what are they?
2,20,Michael,The reason is friends!
2,20,Michael,"You're my friend, Janet."
2,20,Michael,That's why I can't kill you.
2,20,Michael,We have been through so much together.
2,20,Michael,"I mean, yeah, sure, for you, each time I rebooted you, you met me all over again."
2,20,Michael,"But for me, our relationship has become important."
2,20,Michael,"You're my oldest, my truest, my most loyal friend."
2,20,Michael,I can't just get rid of you and replace you with some other Janet I don't even know.
2,20,Janet,"Well, well, well"
2,20,Michael,Don't do that.
2,20,Michael,Just lay off.
2,20,Janet,Michael!
2,20,Janet,That was so nice of you.
2,20,Janet,I'm glad you said that.
2,20,Michael,"Well, I mean it."
2,20,Janet,"Look at us, a couple of old pals, trying to make our way in this crazy world that I built."
2,20,Janet,Two peas in a pod.
2,20,Janet,One of whom needs to kill the other one immediately.
2,20,Janet,"Michael, come on."
2,20,Janet,Kill me!
2,20,Michael,"No, there has to be another way."
2,20,Michael,"This problem you're facing, it's about emotion, right?"
2,20,Michael,That's a human problem.
2,20,Michael,So maybe we should consult our most problematic human.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, let me get this straight."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You want me to convince Michael to turn you into a marble because you're causing earthquakes, because you're sad about Jason, to whom you were once married, because he's currently sleeping with Tahani?"
2,20,Janet,Correct.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't think I've ever meant this literally, but that might be too much information."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First of all, I totally get the Jason thing."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's a ding-dong, but also a straight hottie, so up top."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But more important, what you're going through is something every person has gone through."
2,20,Janet,Not a person.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, right now, you kind of are, because you just found out your ex is dating someone else."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And yeah, it sucks, but trust me, it's not worth all this drama."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need to get drunk and go dancing.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'll forget all about Jason.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you get drunk?
2,20,Janet,Not really.
2,20,Janet,"Although, if I stand next to a powerful array of magnets, I do get pretty loopy."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do that.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Pop a couple magnets, listen to some No Doubt, dye your hair."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'll be totally fine in two seconds.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, the best move is to get another dude and just go to town."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,Rebound guy!
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I guess here, your options are pretty limited."
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about Michael?
2,20,Janet,Extraordinarily bad idea.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,Forget it.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,But you don't need to worry.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're awesome.
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You contain all the knowledge in the universe, you have a rippin' bod and you can literally do anything!"
2,20,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is just a blip.
2,20,Michael,"So, was it helpful?"
2,20,Janet,"Yes, Eleanor told me instead of being sad, I should, ""Go get it, girl!"""
2,20,Janet,"So, I'm going to go get it, girl!"
2,20,Michael,Get what?
2,20,Janet,Unclear.
2,20,Janet,"I'll get everything, to be safe."
2,20,Janet,I should be able to avoid glitches by watching what I say around Jason and Tahani.
2,20,Janet,Thank you for your help.
2,20,Janet,I'm glad we're friends.
2,20,Michael,"Me, too."
2,20,Janet,"Since we're friends, I can tell you this honestly."
2,20,Janet,Take that outfit out of rotation.
2,20,Janet,It makes you look bottom-heavy.
2,20,Michael,"It does, doesn't it?"
2,20,Janet,"If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go to my void for a little while."
2,20,Janet,I need to spend some time alone and focus on myself.
2,20,Michael,Take all the time you need.
2,20,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Hello!
2,20,Michael,"Janet, who's that man?"
2,20,Janet,"This is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek."
2,20,Janet,I made him.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"Hi, I'm Derek."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,You must be --
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh okay, that makes more sense."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,You must be Michael.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Janet's made a lot of talk-talk into my earholes about you.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"Michael, Michael, Klichael, Klichael."
2,20,Michael,"Janet, you can't make a person."
2,20,Janet,I know.
2,20,Janet,"But I did, though."
2,20,Janet,"Eleanor said that to forget about Jason, I should create a rebound guy."
2,20,Janet,"So, I made one."
2,20,Janet,Derek!
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,I'm her boyfriend and she made me.
2,20,Janet,He's so nice.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Whoa!
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Look at this glass.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, my God."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"I'm in there, too?"
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,What's going on right now?
2,20,Janet,"It's my first time making someone, so he might be a bit off."
2,20,Michael,This could be please put that down.
2,20,Michael,This could be very dangerous!
2,20,Michael,It shouldn't even be possible.
2,20,Janet,Maybe not 800 reboots ago.
2,20,Janet,"But apparently, now it is."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Can you believe this?
2,20,Michael,"Derek, is it Derek?"
2,20,Janet,It's Derek.
2,20,Michael,"Derek, could you please give me and Janet a moment alone?"
2,20,Janet,Go back to the void.
2,20,Janet,I'll be there in a minute.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"Okay, I'll miss you like crazy."
2,20,Janet,I'll miss you more.
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,"No, I'll miss you more."
2,20,Derek Hofstetler,Bye!
2,20,Janet,"What a dork, am I right?"
2,21,Michael,"Janet, you can't just go around inventing people."
2,21,Michael,Get rid of him immediately.
2,21,Janet,No.
2,21,Janet,Eleanor said to find a rebound guy.
2,21,Janet,"I couldn't find one, so I made one."
2,21,Janet,He's helping me forget about Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Janet,Honey.
2,21,Janet,Babe
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason.
2,21,Janet,Babe!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Ja --
2,21,Janet,Don't be jealous.
2,21,Janet,I love you now.
2,21,Janet,We'll spend every second together.
2,21,Michael,"No, no!"
2,21,Michael,"No, you are not."
2,21,Michael,"Janet, no one can know about I'm sorry, what's your name again?"
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek Hostetler.
2,21,Michael,"If anybody finds out about him, we are doomed."
2,21,Michael,He has to stay in your void.
2,21,Janet,It's our void now.
2,21,Janet,We moved in together!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,What?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Can you believe it?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I got a hanger for my jumpsuit.
2,21,Michael,What do you --
2,21,Michael,"I mean, that's so fast!"
2,21,Janet,"When you know, you know."
2,21,Janet,And we know literally everything.
2,21,Janet,"We are so in sync, we're finishing each other's --"
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek!
2,21,Michael,"Hey, guys."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, you frightened me."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jason's making me watch this horror film about two ex-convicts who try to rob and murder a neglected child.
2,21,Michael,Hey!
2,21,Michael,I got some great news.
2,21,Michael,I've arranged for you to have a weekend getaway.
2,21,Michael,I bet you're tired of being cooped up here.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am a bit.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,All this time indoors has degraded my skin from radiant to merely dewy.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Me?
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Dewy?
2,21,Michael,There's going to be plenty of sun and fun at the private campsite I set up for you at the edge of the neighborhood.
2,21,Michael,Here you go.
2,21,Michael,I told Vicky I'll be torturing you for the time being.
2,21,Michael,"Relax, live it up."
2,21,Michael,Out you go.
2,21,Michael,Here.
2,21,Michael,"Now, sadly, Janet is still offline so you can't call her, okay?"
2,21,Michael,"The best news is, none of this is suspicious."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know what's gonna happen to us, but I need to tell you something I love you."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,What are you watching?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, Cannonball Run II."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Again?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,You watch that movie a lot.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it's basically my favorite movie of all time."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can't watch it.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,This copy's mine.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-oh.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I guess I'm still pretty selfish.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Help!
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I need another ethics lesson, quick!"
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Weird energy coming from you right now.
2,21,Michael,"Hey, guys."
2,21,Michael,What are you doing?
2,21,Michael,Nothing?
2,21,Michael,Great.
2,21,Michael,"So, Chidi, just want to double-check, how do ethical philosophers feel about murder?"
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,It's frowned upon.
2,21,Michael,"Okay, what if the reason you want to murder someone is to make your life easier?"
2,21,Michael,"That's okay, right?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Is there a problem here, bud?"
2,21,Michael,"Okay, I'll just tell you."
2,21,Michael,"Uh no, too hard to explain."
2,21,Michael,I'll show you.
2,21,Michael,Janet.
2,21,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Hey, there."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who the fork is that?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Derek Hostetler, PI."
2,21,Janet,Derek is my rebound guy.
2,21,Janet,I made him.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did you do that because of what I said?
2,21,Janet,Yes.
2,21,Janet,Because of what you said.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet --
2,21,Janet,Thank you.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Thank you.
2,21,Janet,"You know, you seem so sad."
2,21,Janet,Do you want me to make you a boyfriend?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I could have a brother?
2,21,Janet,Yes!
2,21,Janet,"Based on your last 10,000 comments, it would be ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin's head on Tahani's body."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or vice versa.
2,21,Michael,She's not gonna make you anything.
2,21,Michael,"Janet, that'll be all."
2,21,Janet,Okay.
2,21,Janet,Goodbye.
2,21,Janet,"Say goodbye, Derek."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Goodbob.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I hope we same place again very now.
2,21,Janet,His brain is wrong.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mmm.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Mmm.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The goal is to tap the ball hard enough to go through the wicket, but not so hard it goes too far through."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It combines both classic aspects of British sport, whimsy and restraint."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,So restrained.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I believe it was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who called croquet ""barely a game""."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"It's kind of fun, I guess."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,But can I teach you a different game?
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"You whack it as hard as you can, in whatever direction you want."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Jaguars rule!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Jaguars are very good!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ooh!
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Whoa!
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Nice!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mmm.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Thor!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well done!
2,21,Michael,Okay.
2,21,Michael,Here's where I am on this.
2,21,Michael,We gotta kill Derek.
2,21,Michael,"No, think about it."
2,21,Michael,What if Vicky calls for Janet and Derek shows up too?
2,21,Michael,She'll have questions we can't answer.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,But Derek does seem to be helping Janet get over Jason.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,No earthquakes since he showed up.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if we get rid of Derek, maybe Janet will start glitching again."
2,21,Michael,"If we can't kill Derek, we gotta break up Jason and Tahani."
2,21,Michael,"If that relationship ends, then Janet won't feel sad anymore and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Girl, you are a messy bench who loves drama and I am into it."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, Michael, but that's also ethically dicey."
2,21,Michael,Here comes the egghead.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Jason and Tahani are happy together.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Telling them he was once married to Janet might cause them harm.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,It's not permissible to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But isn't keeping a secret from someone basically like lying, though?"
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"No, it's okay to keep a secret, as long as it isn't harming anyone and telling them that secret might cause harm."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Noice!
2,21,Michael,Cool.
2,21,Michael,"Good point, egghead."
2,21,Michael,"I'll tell you what else would cause them harm, getting caught and sent to the real Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, which will happen if Derek blows our cover."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,I know!
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,But we'll also be sent to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"I know it's tempting to take a shortcut, but moral strength is defined by how we behave in times of stress."
2,21,Michael,Has anyone ever told you what a drag you are?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Everyone.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Constantly.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I hereby pronounce you King Jason.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Dope.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Where did you learn how to do this?
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The Hertfordshire Academy for Expressionless Girls, a finishing school I attended before Oxford, and then of course the Sorbonne."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I haven't asked where you were educated.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School in northeast Jacksonville, which was really just a bunch of tugboats tied together."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Didn't you get seasick?
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"No, sorry, they were tired together in a junkyard."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,It wasn't a very good school.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"For most of my classes, we sold dirty magazines door-to-door."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, Jason, every single detail about your life is deeply disturbing."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And yet, I envy you."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was never allowed to goof off.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I never had a friend I could be myself around.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Maybe I can be that friend.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Or your husband!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, stop it."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"No, no, no, I'm serious."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Will you marry me?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tell Janet Derek can stay, but she's gotta keep him under wraps, so none of the other demons find out."
2,21,Michael,Fine.
2,21,Michael,"As long as they fly under the radar and Janet stays happy, I think we'll be safe."
2,21,Michael,Janet?
2,21,Janet,You always do this!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,You don't respect me and you never have!
2,21,Janet,You make a federal case out of everything!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Because to you, I'll always be that guy you made!"
2,21,Michael,Guys!
2,21,Michael,What's going on?
2,21,Janet,Can we not do this in front of my friends?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,So they're your friends now.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I'm stating a fact.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,They are your friends.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I don't know these people.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I am out of here.
2,21,Janet,"Oh, great, Derek."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I'm gonna go back to our void and I'm gonna try and forget this ever happened.
2,21,Janet,It is not your void.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Oh.
2,21,Janet,It is my void!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Wow.
2,21,Janet,"I know it's a boundless, barren nothingness, but you are always there."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Fine, I'll go somewhere else."
2,21,Janet,Fine!
2,21,Michael,"No, not fine!"
2,21,Michael,Don't go somewhere else!
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're forked, aren't we?"
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, Jason, you're lovely and I've had a wonderful time these past few weeks, but why on Earth would I marry you?"
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Decent point.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Also, we like each other."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,And I promise to always be nice to you.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll marry you.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I need some time to plan a proper reception.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Where will everyone sit?
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael and Janet opposite Chidi and Eleanor or Michael and Eleanor opposite Janet and Chidi?
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Let's have it today.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,At the beach!
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"The beach is where all the best stuff happens, like swimsuit issues and Saving Private Ryan, and Jersey Shore and crabs!"
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I hope Janet's back online."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
2,21,Janet,"Hi, there."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is everything all right?
2,21,Janet,Yeah.
2,21,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
2,21,Janet,Everything's fine.
2,21,Janet,It's okay.
2,21,Janet,I'm fine.
2,21,Janet,So it's all fine.
2,21,Janet,How can I help you?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Wait.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,There he is!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,How are you?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Nice to meet you.
2,21,Michael,"Derek, get down!"
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Come here!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I am not coming down because I meant to come here.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I came here on purpose 'cause this tree is my new house.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"This is Derek's house and Janet's not allowed in, because I booby-trapped it."
2,21,Janet,Hi.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Janet!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,You're here!
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Thank God!
2,21,Janet,"Derek, I am not talking to you right now."
2,21,Janet,I am here to announce that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil are getting married this evening.
2,21,Michael,"""The ceremony will be private, but we think it would be totally dope if you biznatches came and got turnt up with us afterward."""
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"How come you never get this upset at anything I do, Janet?"
2,21,Janet,"Do not start with me right now, Derek!"
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I will start it.
2,21,All,"No, no, no, don't."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Do not avoid me by going to the void!
2,21,All,"No, no, no!"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,What a little bench!
2,21,Michael,Things are falling apart here.
2,21,Michael,"Chidi, I understand the ethics involved, but we need to stop that wedding!"
2,21,Michael,We break up Jason and Tahani.
2,21,Michael,Janet stops being sad.
2,21,Michael,Derek goes away.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"Fine, but there's something called the doctrine of double effect."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"To remain ethical, you can't go into this with the intention of killing Derek."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Your only goal has to be to spare Jason and Tahani from future pain by filling them in on Jason's past.
2,21,Michael,"No, I got you."
2,21,Michael,"So, ethically we should tell Jason he used to be married to Janet and it would be terrible if that ultimately led to Derek's death."
2,21,Michael,Wink.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,No.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Winking is bad.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"You should not be winking or saying the word ""wink""."
2,21,Michael,Okay.
2,21,Michael,We really need to kill we really need to kill any suspicion that I wanna murder Derek.
2,21,Michael,Boom!
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wink.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Tahani, you're so smart."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Every day you teach me something new about art and history, and why I shouldn't eat everything that smells good because sometimes it's candles."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"You're basically like a hot, genius teacher who sometimes has sex with me, your student."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"That used to happen a lot at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School, but this time you won't be arrested."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Oh.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"I love you, Tahani."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Braap, braap, braap, braap!"
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Pew!
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Pew!
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, I never guessed we'd be where we are today."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Me, a prominent British philanthropist with award-winning legs, set to marry you, a swamp dweller who once asked me if the presidents on Mount Rushmore have butts on the other side."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We don't make any sense together, yet, when I'm with you, I can really let my hair down."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Metaphorically speaking, since I'd never have it up in the first place."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm not a factory worker.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,But you've helped me to see that there is more to life than just appearances.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I think I love --"
2,21,Michael,Wait!
2,21,Michael,Stop the ceremony!
2,21,Michael,This wedding cannot happen.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This is not helpful, but I have always wanted to be a part of a wedding that was stopped dramatically."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,We can't get married?
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Why not?
2,21,Michael,Because because hang on a second.
2,21,Michael,I can't do it.
2,21,Michael,Professor Buzzkill got in my head.
2,21,Michael,I'm thinking about all the rules I have to follow to stay ethical.
2,21,Michael,Someone else has to do this.
2,21,Michael,I no.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I hate to be the bearer of bad news --
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, I think you mean ""bad news bear""."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Before all the reboots, Jason was married to Janet."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why Janet's been glitching.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because she's sad.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,She misses Jason.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In fact, she was so sad that she well Derek?"
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Well, well, well."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Jason Mendoza.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,At last we meet.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"You've got a lot of nerve, buddy."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, I'm Eleanor, man."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,What?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everybody, this is Derek."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet made Derek as a boyfriend to try and rebound from Jason.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I feel quite light-headed."
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, fetch my tizzy couch, please."
2,21,Michael,Decision time.
2,21,Michael,"Any second, someone'll realize we're all missing."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you reboot all of us?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani and Jason will forget they were ever in love.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It was a fluky thing, it probably won't happen again, and Chidi and I can forget anything we want to forget."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, like personal bloopers that were embarrassing or days where we were very gassy, et cetera."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We'll meet back in your office, you bring us up to speed and we go from there."
2,21,Michael,"No, no, no, we're not starting over."
2,21,Michael,We've come too far.
2,21,Michael,Our only options are to reboot either Janet or Derek.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Neither one is permissible as your primary intention.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"The doctrine of double effect, remember?"
2,21,Michael,"Well, man, I'm working with the doctrine of not being completely effed."
2,21,Michael,Okay?
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,I don't understand what you even like about Jason.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,What does he have that I don't?
2,21,Janet,A soul.
2,21,Janet,And genitals.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Here we go with this whole no-genitals thing again.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,You gave me wind chimes instead of a penis.
2,21,Janet,This isn't about your wind chime penis.
2,21,Janet,It's not about you at all.
2,21,Janet,"I don't even know what it is about, which is very confusing, because the whole point of me is that I know everything!"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can I speak to you alone for a second?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, look, when you said you were sad about Jason and I suggested, ""Hey, find a rebound guy"", it's 'cause I thought it was some schoolgirl crush, like some guy you made out with a couple of times in the walk-in freezer of a Bruegger's Bagels."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not based on a real example.
2,21,Janet,"Yes, it is."
2,21,Janet,His name was Marcus Bicksburger.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Marcus""?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I always called him Ben.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I gave you bad advice."
2,21,Janet,Uh-huh.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason was clearly important to you.
2,21,Janet,Yeah.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,And real heartbreak doesn't have a simple cure.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,You will feel better after some time goes by.
2,21,Janet,I don't really experience the passing of time.
2,21,Janet,I do use it as a lotion occasionally.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Weird, but keep doing it 'cause your skin looks amazing."
2,21,Janet,Thank you.
2,21,Janet,Not skin.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, to get through a real heartbreak, you have to sit with your feelings and mull it over and power through."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you have to talk about it.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Talking about your feelings is the worst.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's so much easier to find a rebound guy and have sex about your feelings.
2,21,Janet,I don't know if I wanna talk to Jason right now.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's cool.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Until then, if you ever need a friend to talk to, just know I'm here."
2,21,Janet,There's no easy way to say this.
2,21,Janet,I never should have made you.
2,21,Janet,It's time for you to go away.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"I understand, because you understand."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Janet, this relationship has been the best seven hours of my whole life."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,It's been the only seven hours of my whole life.
2,21,Janet,I made you this morning.
2,21,Janet,We all remember.
2,21,Janet,"Okay, you ready to do this?"
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Yep.
2,21,Michael,Janet.
2,21,Michael,What are you doing?
2,21,Janet,I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts and emotions.
2,21,Janet,This is the only way I can reabsorb them.
2,21,Janet,It'll just be a minute.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dang it.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is some hot reabsorbing.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Can you get pregnant from reabsorbing?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-oh.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I hear wind chimes.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everybody, look away."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll keep watching, but you guys look away."
2,21,Janet,"Goodbye, Derek."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Goodbye, mommy-girlfriend."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,"Bye, everybody."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek's going away now.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Does he seem a little bit still alive?
2,21,Janet,He's about as dead as he can be.
2,21,Janet,Like he's in power saver mode.
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you worried you might start glitching again?
2,21,Janet,No.
2,21,Janet,I'll be okay now that I understand what I'm going through and now I know I can talk to my friends about it.
2,21,Janet,I'm gonna toss this steamer trunk containing the lifeless husk of my ex-boyfriend into a remote corner of my limitless void.
2,21,Janet,"Bye, guys."
2,21,Derek Hofstetler,Derek!
2,21,Jason Mendoza,I'm kinda glad we didn't get married today.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Me too.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,We don't know that much about each other.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Like, who was the first person you kissed?"
2,21,Jason Mendoza,The sexy mouse robot in the Chuck E. Cheese band.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, it was --"
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's probably enough get-to-know-each-other for now.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,We'll take things slow.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,"I know I'm technically married to Janet, but I don't remember it at all."
2,21,Jason Mendoza,I'm sorry that it puts you in a weird position.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,And I still like you a lot.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,Me too.
2,21,Tahani Al-Jamil,What happens now?
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Don't know.
2,21,Jason Mendoza,Do you wanna try reabsorbing me?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,Something wrong?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yep.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've been keeping a secret from you about you.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,What is it?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The thing is it's not even harming you and if I tell you, I feel like it might harm you."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, ethically speaking, I don't think I have to tell you."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, forget all that."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"This is freaking me out, I'm losing my mind, so tell me."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you, too."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,I've never been that certain about anything.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,I once even tried to rent socks.
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,How did I say that that easily?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I get how you said it.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm a total smoke-show.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,But how did I say it so easily?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't wanna talk about this, but after everything that's happened today, we gotta."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, let's just get it all out there."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um yeah, I guess, do you I don't know."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have feelings like that for me again now?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, but I don't think I do."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Sorry""?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are you sorry?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cause I'm relieved, because I don't either."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, all good."
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, I feel incredibly close to you --"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no!"
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,In many --
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't need to explain yourself.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,We are on the same page.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good.
2,21,Michael,"Hey, guys."
2,21,Michael,"Sorry, I know it's late."
2,21,Michael,Can I talk to Eleanor for a second?
2,21,Chidi Anagonye,We're chatting about something right now.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's cool, we were wrapping up."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good talk, bro."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's on your mind?
2,21,Michael,"Well, being ethical, it's hard."
2,21,Michael,And I kind of hate it.
2,21,Michael,When's it get easier?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you ask Chidi?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's the ethics master.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm a newbie and I still suck at it.
2,21,Michael,Yeah.
2,21,Michael,That's why I'm asking you.
2,21,Michael,"I designed this entire torture chamber around the absolute certainty that when the going got tough, you would give up."
2,21,Michael,That was the signature Shellstrop move.
2,21,Michael,"Do you remember once when your ""change oil"" light came on?"
2,21,Michael,You abandoned your car in a parking garage.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course.
2,21,Michael,"But here, faced with the toughest challenges I could throw at you, you never once stopped trying to become a better person and I just why?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whenever I would do something crappy on Earth, there would be a tiny voice in the back of my head that would say, ""Eleanor, don't grab that handful of olives from the salad bar."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You didn't pay for that."""
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or, ""Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits onto the floor of the grocery store."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's not cool."""
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or, ""Eleanor, that old man slipped on your olive pit and he fell down."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't use the fact everyone's distracted to steal more olives."""
2,21,Michael,I get it.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This ethics stuff, it's hard and it's confusing."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,It is such a buzzkill.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But it does get rid of the little voice, because at least I'm trying to do the right thing instead of the crappy thing."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I gotta say, man, I don't miss the little voice."
2,21,Michael,"Well, thank you for helping me today."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You, uh you really did just come here to chat, didn't you?"
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just shoot the shirt with your old pal, Eleanor."
2,21,Michael,"I guess so, yeah."
2,21,Michael,Why?
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's just a very human-y thing to do.
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Stick with the program, demon buddy."
2,21,Eleanor Shellstrop,I feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
2,21,Shawn,"Hello, Michael."
2,21,Shawn,Shut the door.
2,21,Shawn,Have a seat.
2,22,Shawn,"Hello, Michael."
2,22,Shawn,Shut the door.
2,22,Shawn,Have a seat.
2,22,Shawn,"When you proposed this new form of torture, we all laughed behind your back."
2,22,Shawn,"Some people called you names, like the Thomas Edison of incompetence or ""that dick""."
2,22,Shawn,But it seems you've pulled it off.
2,22,Shawn,What you've done here is amazing.
2,22,Michael,Really?
2,22,Shawn,Yes.
2,22,Shawn,These reports are remarkable.
2,22,Shawn,Your humans are experiencing emotional torture at the same level of physical torture created by our squiggliest eyeball corkscrews.
2,22,Shawn,I'm jubilant.
2,22,Shawn,"As a result of our success, I'm getting a seat on the High Council."
2,22,Shawn,We will expand our neighborhood idea and you will oversee the project.
2,22,Shawn,You are being promoted.
2,22,Shawn,Your senior staff pin.
2,22,Shawn,Congratulations.
2,22,Shawn,This is everything you've ever wanted.
2,22,Michael,This is everything I've ever wanted.
2,22,Michael,Oh!
2,22,Michael,This is everything I've ever wanted!
2,22,Michael,"Oh, wow!"
2,22,Michael,You're really happy?
2,22,Shawn,Can't you tell?
2,22,Shawn,I'm basically squealing like a birthday girl.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"At some point, we should discuss yesterday's events."
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Do you mean us almost getting married and then finding out I was married to Janet?
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Then Janet making a boyfriend to forget me and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend?
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Or do you mean when we saw that cool cloud?
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,The first bit.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Perhaps after Michael briefs us on how we're going to be fake-tortured today, we can sit down and chat?"
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Good idea.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, Chidi?"
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah?
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?
2,22,Shawn,Come in.
2,22,Michael,I'd like to start by saying something I wanted to say for a very long time.
2,22,Michael,"Surprise, idiots!"
2,22,Michael,You're all in the Bad Place.
2,22,Michael,"That's right, nerds."
2,22,Michael,"Everything around you, all you can see, is an elaborate system of torture designed just for you."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, we're in the Bad Place?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why are you revealing this now?
2,22,Michael,It was an experiment and it worked.
2,22,Michael,"So, my boss is promoting me."
2,22,Michael,"Sorry, I should've introduced you."
2,22,Michael,"This is my boss, Shawn."
2,22,Shawn,"Hello, imbeciles."
2,22,Shawn,We need to study everything that happened here.
2,22,Shawn,"There was a first version that collapsed, but the second has been a huge success."
2,22,Shawn,We'll shut this place down.
2,22,Shawn,"The four of you will be brought to the real Bad Place, where your brains will be removed, studied, then batted about a stadium like beach balls."
2,22,Shawn,Your arms will be peeled like bananas.
2,22,Shawn,That part's just for fun.
2,22,Michael,Right.
2,22,Shawn,"And then you will be, you know, tortured forever."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, is this all true?"
2,22,Michael,"Yes, Eleanor, it is."
2,22,Michael,"You're such a rube, thinking you could become a better person."
2,22,Michael,You got Chidi to teach you stupid philosophy?
2,22,Michael,Like those old farts were gonna provide guidance.
2,22,Michael,"""Oh, Kierkegaard is so great."
2,22,Michael,"Have you read Fear and Trembling?"""
2,22,Michael,"Well, I don't know."
2,22,Michael,Have you read Boring and Stupid?
2,22,Michael,Because that's what you are.
2,22,Shawn,Nice.
2,22,Michael,Thank you.
2,22,Shawn,How long will it take you to shut down the neighborhood?
2,22,Michael,Better part of a day.
2,22,Michael,"In the meantime, why don't we have a farewell party tonight?"
2,22,Michael,To thank the crew for all the hard work?
2,22,Michael,We could jam to some tunes.
2,22,Michael,"Destroy the place, play beer pong with Jason's testicles."
2,22,Michael,"What do you say, boss?"
2,22,Shawn,Sure.
2,22,Shawn,"By the way, I know what you're thinking."
2,22,Shawn,"""Maybe Janet can help."""
2,22,Michael,Ah.
2,22,Shawn,You're wrong.
2,22,Shawn,Janet?
2,22,Janet,"Oh, hi, little cuties."
2,22,Janet,I love you guys so much.
2,22,Janet,"Except for you, Jason, because I hate you."
2,22,Janet,I hate you.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
2,22,Janet,"Oh, where's my phone?"
2,22,Michael,"We put a Restraining Bracelet on her, disrupting her powers."
2,22,Janet,It's made of mag-a-nets.
2,22,Janet,Mag-nets.
2,22,Janet,Mag-a-nittens
2,22,Janet,Magnets are supposed to make me feel drunk.
2,22,Janet,But guess what?
2,22,Janet,I feel fine.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Why is it always the ones you most expect?
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,I should've seen this coming.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,No one can truly turn over a new leaf.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ben Affleck told me he'd matured after he directed Argo.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But then, right on schedule, it was, ""Guess what, Tahani?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm gonna be Batman!"""
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,There's only one option.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Shawn clearly doesn't know Michael has rebooted this neighborhood 800 times.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,I say we trade that information for some kind of reduced sentence.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi, they're monsters."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Who's to say they won't agree to a deal, hear what we have to say and then turn around and install us into their horrible human zoo?"
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,There's no other option.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,There's no way for a human to get that bracelet off Janet.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If there were, we could get her to call us a train to Mindy St. Claire's house."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,We know for a fact the people from the Bad Place can't follow us there and I vote for that.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,I vote we
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, sorry."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And no offense, Jason, but the stakes here are too high to let someone with your limited intellectual processing capacity weigh in."
2,22,Jason Mendoza,I was gonna agree with you.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, great."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's two votes for my plan.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,All right.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, what do you think?"
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Trade information on Michael or try to escape to the Medium Place?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Neither.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I vote we ignore everything Michael just said and assume he's still on our side.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's with me?
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, but when all this started, you said Michael wasn't trustworthy."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Now you want us to trust him?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,For one very specific and rock-solid reason.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's-his-name.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Who?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,The dude!
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The super depressing religious guy, the real buzzkill whose name I can never remember."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Keeblers car.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kyra.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sedgwick?
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I love her."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Dear friend of mine.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not important right now.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Kierkegaard?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes!
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kierkegaard!
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When Michael was mocking us, whose name did he use?"
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kierkegaard.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,He was sending us a message.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,To take a leap of faith.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cause that was Kierkegaard's thing, right?"
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, but it's probably better translated as ""a leap into faith""."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's so hard to be your friend.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael wants us to trust him.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I had a long talk with him the other night about the whole Derek incident.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude was shook.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Talking about ethics and all spiraling about human stuff.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think he's on our side.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Or he's a supernatural demon designed to torture people, who got offered his dream job and has flipped on us like a ten-stone griddle-chip."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a large pancake.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Come on, you can get these from context."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe Michael jumped back to the dark side, but I don't think so."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think he's gonna help us escape.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know it sounds crazy.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if it weren't crazy, they wouldn't call it ""a leap of faith""."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They would call it ""a sit of doubting""."
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"I never thought I'd be the one to say it, but this is getting out of hand."
2,22,Jason Mendoza,We gotta go to the cops.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,What cops?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where do you think we are?
2,22,Shawn,"Before tonight's party, I'd love to talk more about your strategy for torturing Tahani."
2,22,Shawn,I'm impressed you were able to make her fall in love with Jason.
2,22,Shawn,She must be miserable.
2,22,Michael,Yeah.
2,22,Michael,Humans make a lot of mistakes when they're horny.
2,22,Michael,"Ah, boss, give me a second here."
2,22,Vicky,"What the here, dude?"
2,22,Michael,Vicky
2,22,Vicky,My hard work paid off for you and now you're just taking all the credit.
2,22,Michael,"Vicky, this can work out great for both of us, if we play our cards right."
2,22,Michael,"Shawn thinks that this is attempt number two, right?"
2,22,Michael,"If I tell him you've been in charge of this version, he'll find out there have been hundreds of failed versions."
2,22,Vicky,"Oh, right."
2,22,Michael,"And if that happens, we're all going down."
2,22,Michael,"So, spread the word."
2,22,Michael,No one talks about the reboots.
2,22,Vicky,Fine.
2,22,Vicky,But you better make this right.
2,22,Vicky,Mama want promotion.
2,22,Vicky,Ya heard?
2,22,Michael,"Hello, you dummies!"
2,22,Michael,This neighborhood was a labor of hate for many people here.
2,22,Michael,So I thought that we should celebrate with an art form that we literally invented here in the Bad Place.
2,22,Michael,The comedy roast.
2,22,Michael,I see Jason Mendoza's here.
2,22,Michael,"Jason might not be the smartest guy in the world, but he is the dumbest guy in the world."
2,22,Michael,"Oh, Jason, buddy."
2,22,Michael,All you had to do was to keep quiet.
2,22,Michael,But you couldn't keep talking about Kendall Jenner or that dumb quarterback.
2,22,Michael,What was his name?
2,22,Michael,Derek Bortles?
2,22,Michael,Always ranting about Derek Bortles.
2,22,Michael,"Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games are the only ones televised in the Bad Place because they suck!"
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"No, they don't!"
2,22,Jason Mendoza,All we need is a defense and an offense and some rule changes.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't take it personally.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,He has to put on a show for the other demons.
2,22,Michael,Tahani Al-Jamil.
2,22,Michael,"Elegance, grace, sophistication."
2,22,Michael,But enough about your sister!
2,22,Michael,You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?
2,22,Michael,When the last song played at one of her parties and she would run off and cry because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.
2,22,Michael,You know the other worst moment of Tahani's life?
2,22,Michael,"Every other moment of her empty, pointless life!"
2,22,Michael,I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.
2,22,Michael,Eleanor and I have a lot in common.
2,22,Michael,Here's how you tell us apart.
2,22,Michael,"One of us is a manipulative demon who's an expert at making other people miserable, and then the other one is me!"
2,22,Michael,You thought you deserved a Medium Place like Mindy St. Claire?
2,22,Michael,Are you kidding me?
2,22,Michael,"You're bad, Eleanor."
2,22,Michael,This is exactly the place you should be.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not super funny for a roast, there, bud."
2,22,Michael,"Oh, you want a joke?"
2,22,Michael,You love Chidi and Chidi doesn't love you back.
2,22,Michael,Boom!
2,22,Michael,Now that's funny because it's very cruel and humiliating.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,I consider you one of my closest friends.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not now, dude."
2,22,Michael,"""Speaking of Chidi,"" is something no one has ever said because no one talks about Chidi, because no one likes Chidi, because he's so annoying about ethics."
2,22,Michael,"Now, when you taught the trolley problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley?"
2,22,Michael,Because all your students did.
2,22,Michael,Whoo-hoo!
2,22,Michael,"Whoa, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud."
2,22,Michael,"Uh, knock-knock."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Who's there?
2,22,Michael,You died alone because you couldn't commit to anyone.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"""You died alone because you couldn't commit to anyone,"" who?"
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,22,Michael,Jason Mendoza!
2,22,Michael,"Okay, that's all my time."
2,22,Michael,Let's tear this mother to the ground!
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, maybe I was wrong and Michael isn't on our side."
2,22,Bad Janet,"What up, fart sticks?"
2,22,Bad Janet,"That was ""She Hates Me"" by Puddle of Mudd."
2,22,Bad Janet,"Coming up next, ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer""."
2,22,Bad Janet,Idiots.
2,22,Toddrick Hemple,We're going streaking!
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The one time I think someone isn't lying to me, it bits me in the ash."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I guess Michael really did flip back to the bad side.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, does one think?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,That roast was the meanest thing I've ever seen and I once saw a waiter bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, we have no choice."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,We go to Shawn and we say we'll trade secret information about the reboots if he'll go easy on us.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"And if that doesn't work, we try to free Janet and go to Mindy's."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Agreed?
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Michael sucks now.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"He pretended to be our friend, he's gonna torture us for eternity and you know what the worst part is?"
2,22,Jason Mendoza,He's forgotten my favorite football player's name.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Definitely not the worst part.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,It is to me!
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Blake Bortles is a cool name.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
2,22,Vicky,"Hey, man."
2,22,Vicky,Have you told Shawn how hugely important I was yet?
2,22,Michael,I will get to it.
2,22,Michael,Promise.
2,22,Michael,"Now you just relax, enjoy yourself."
2,22,Michael,Rip a cat in half.
2,22,Michael,"It's a party, Vicky."
2,22,Michael,Come on!
2,22,Vicky,Hey!
2,22,Vicky,What does Michael keep whispering to you?
2,22,Janet,"Um, something, something, Vicky."
2,22,Janet,"Something, something."
2,22,Janet,"Uh, can I braid your hair?"
2,22,Vicky,No.
2,22,Janet,Please.
2,22,Vicky,No.
2,22,Vicky,I got it.
2,22,Janet,Ooh!
2,22,Vicky,Hey!
2,22,Vicky,Help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.
2,22,Gayle,No.
2,22,Gayle,Shawn put them on her for a reason.
2,22,Gayle,I'm not overruling the boss.
2,22,Vicky,"You're such a suck-up, Gayle."
2,22,Janet,Can I braid your hair?
2,22,Vicky,No.
2,22,Vicky,I got it.
2,22,Vicky,Okay
2,22,Janet,Ow!
2,22,Janet,"Get your own bracelets, Victoria."
2,22,Bad Janet,"Okay, you fat dinks, the sun is up, and we're about to close it down with one last song."
2,22,Bad Janet,"""She Hates Me"" by Puddle of Mudd and ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" played at the same time."
2,22,Shawn,"Honestly, I'm still partial to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers, but you've done great work here."
2,22,Michael,Can't thank you enough for everything.
2,22,Vicky,"Shawn, wait."
2,22,Michael,No --
2,22,Vicky,"I have some very interesting information, about who is really responsible for this neighborhood."
2,22,Michael,"Shawn, the humans are escaping."
2,22,Vicky,It's Michael.
2,22,Vicky,Michael's responsible for this neighborhood and everything that's happening right now.
2,22,Vicky,Bye!
2,22,Michael,I --
2,22,Shawn,Bad Janet!
2,22,Bad Janet,"What's cracking, nutbutts?"
2,22,Shawn,"Call us another train, immediately."
2,22,Shawn,Party's over.
2,22,Michael,How did they get Janet's bracelets off?
2,22,Michael,It's impossible for a human to do.
2,22,Michael,It's like breathing underwater or driving without texting.
2,22,Gayle,"Shawn, I don't wanna make any accusations, but I accuse Vicky."
2,22,Gayle,She asked me to help her take Janet's bracelets off.
2,22,Michael,"Oh, Vicky, you didn't."
2,22,Michael,She definitely did.
2,22,Michael,She's jealous.
2,22,Michael,She's been trying to sabotage me the entire time.
2,22,Vicky,What?
2,22,Vicky,No.
2,22,Vicky,He's lying.
2,22,Vicky,"Okay, I did try to get the bracelets off, but I couldn't!"
2,22,Michael,Listen to yourself.
2,22,Michael,You sound crazy.
2,22,Shawn,"Normally, I would love hearing a man tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't."
2,22,Shawn,You aided the humans to spite Michael.
2,22,Shawn,You're no demon.
2,22,Shawn,You're a jerk.
2,22,Vicky,"Wait, this is a trick."
2,22,Vicky,Michael is the traitor.
2,22,Vicky,I bet they're still here.
2,22,Vicky,This place stretches for a thousand miles.
2,22,Michael,Fine.
2,22,Michael,Bad Janet?
2,22,Bad Janet,What?
2,22,Michael,"Scan the neighborhood, please."
2,22,Bad Janet,"No sign of any humans, but I did find something for Vicky."
2,22,Vicky,What?
2,22,Shawn,"Bad Janet, great stuff as always."
2,22,Bad Janet,"No, duh."
2,22,Shawn,And as for Vicky
2,22,Vicky,"No, wait."
2,22,Shawn,This is a PR disaster.
2,22,Shawn,We have to keep it under wraps.
2,22,Shawn,Get her on the train.
2,22,Shawn,"And if anyone else says a word of what happened here to anyone, you will be in a cocoon, just like Vicky, and it is gooey in there."
2,22,Michael,How do we get the humans back from Mindy's?
2,22,Shawn,"They bought themselves some time, but we'll get them."
2,22,Shawn,I'll start the extradition papers.
2,22,Shawn,You stay here.
2,22,Shawn,I want every trace of this neighborhood erased.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,That was a bad idea!
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"That was so scary, so many different times."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,I hated that.
2,22,Michael,You guys!
2,22,Michael,I was so scared for you.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Told you he was on our side!
2,22,Michael,You're my friends and I wanted to save you.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, it's okay, bud."
2,22,Janet,"This is the best summer ever, you guys."
2,22,Michael,Oh.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Michael, we never doubted you for a moment."
2,22,Michael,"Thank you, Tahani."
2,22,Michael,"You're lying, though, right?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,I doubted you very strongly.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,But then I figured it out.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Kierkegaard, baby!"
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Leap of faith.
2,22,Michael,"It's better translated as ""a leap into faith""."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,You remembered.
2,22,Janet,Can somebody explain what happened?
2,22,Janet,And can you guys be a tiny bit quieter?
2,22,Janet,I've been drunk on magnets all day and I can literally hear every sound in the universe.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Basically, Michael sent us a code and we had to crack it."
2,22,Jason Mendoza,I figured out the first clue.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,No you didn't.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,"I was there, though!"
2,22,Janet,Oh!
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Blake Bortles is a cool name.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Derek Bortles is indeed a very dumb name.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a clue.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no way Michael would've forgotten that name.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,You say it a million times a day.
2,22,Jason Mendoza,Cause he's the best.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Even I know that.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael was telling us to use Derek, Janet's Derek, for something."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,There were clues in the roast.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everybody, quietly but quickly, head to the train station."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's split up so we don't draw attention.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,You guys are the worst conspirators.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,What else did Michael say in the roasts that might be meaningful?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, do you remember?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, he said my entire life was pointless and empty."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but did he say anything we don't already know?"
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Anything that stood out?
2,22,Michael,You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?
2,22,Michael,"When the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry because she still hadn't won her parents' approval."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was odd.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,A host never runs off during the last song.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Because after it's over, you're supposed to act surprised when everyone drags you onstage and showers you with applause."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe Michael wanted us to wait until the end of the party when everyone was at their most distracted.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,And use Derek to drive the train because he has some of Janet's powers.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Janet?
2,22,Janet,Hi.
2,22,Janet,Hey.
2,22,Janet,Hey.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
2,22,Janet,Yep?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need to get Derek from your void.
2,22,Janet,Okay.
2,22,Janet,"Shoot, where's my void, again?"
2,22,Janet,I forget.
2,22,Janet,"Oh, yeah, it's everywhere."
2,22,Janet,"Okay, hang on to your butt cheeks."
2,22,Janet,Ugh.
2,22,Janet,Where is he?
2,22,Janet,Ow.
2,22,Janet,Owie.
2,22,Janet,"I'm never gonna find oh, there he is."
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Janet,Hmm.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Derek, we need you to drive this train and take us to Mindy St. Claire's house."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you do that?
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wait.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nobody get on that train.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek?
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Why not?
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because of what Michael said to me.
2,22,Michael,You though you deserved a Medium Place?
2,22,Michael,"You're bad, Eleanor."
2,22,Michael,This is exactly the place you should be.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael wants us to stay here, for some reason."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, we have a train, a conductor and a safe destination."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Pippa Middleton right before we went paragliding in Gibraltar.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Let's go."""
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's what I said.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, leap of faith."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael said we shouldn't get on that train.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"Any minute now, those demons are gonna come looking for us."
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Where are we supposed to hide?
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no!"
2,22,Michael,"Now, when you taught the trolley problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley?"
2,22,Michael,Because all your students did.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,Uh-uh.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,All aboard!
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,The train is here!
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,It's a train!
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Get on board.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, Derek --"
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're gonna wait until the last song of the night.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And when you do leave, you'll be flying solo."
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Oh.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Maximum Derek.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,Derek headed off.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And when the new train arrived, the four of us crawled underneath before any of the drunk demons saw us."
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,That kept us from being detected when Bad Janet scanned the neighborhood.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,We fooled those mofos like the chumps they are.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,We got all four clues you left us.
2,22,Michael,"Oh, that's great."
2,22,Michael,"Actually, I left you more than 1,200 clues because of how primitive your brains are, but I'm glad you got enough to figure it out."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did you escape detection though?
2,22,Michael,"I'm not ethically proud of this, but I framed Vicky."
2,22,Michael,It was easy.
2,22,Michael,I kept whispering things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.
2,22,Janet,I'm sorry.
2,22,Janet,What did you whisper to me?
2,22,Janet,I don't remember.
2,22,Michael,"Something, something, Vicky."
2,22,Michael,"Something, something."
2,22,Vicky,What does Michael keep whispering to you?
2,22,Janet,"Something, something, Vicky."
2,22,Janet,"Something, something."
2,22,Michael,"And that made her try to take Janet's bracelets off, which framed her for the escape."
2,22,All,Oh!
2,22,Michael,"Guys, I want to apologize for roasting you earlier."
2,22,Michael,I had to sell it since everyone was watching.
2,22,Michael,"It was funny, right?"
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Absolutely not.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,The Tahani stuff was perfect.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, no."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Guys, let's just take a moment here."
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,They're gone.
2,22,Tahani Al-Jamil,Which means that we won and might actually get a chance to go to the real Good Place.
2,22,Chidi Anagonye,This is everything we ever wanted.
2,22,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Speaking of which, I really hope Mindy liked our present."
2,22,Mindy St. Claire,Who are you?
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
2,22,Mindy St. Claire,"""Thanks for helping us all those times we showed up."
2,22,Mindy St. Claire,"To repay you, here's a willing sex robot and two duffel bags full of cocaine."""
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,There are wind chimes where my ding-dong should be.
2,22,Mindy St. Claire,I can work with that.
2,22,Derek Hofstetler,All right.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know about you guys, but I say we leave this miserable shirthole."
2,23,Michael,No.
2,23,Michael,Wait.
2,23,Michael,Wait.
2,23,Michael,Not so fast.
2,23,Michael,Now getting to the Good Place is pretty tricky.
2,23,Michael,There's no train to catch.
2,23,Michael,"I have to design a complicated, unique transportation vehicle."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Is it Optimus Prime?
2,23,Michael,What?
2,23,Jason Mendoza,I can't believe we get to ride a real-life Optimus Prime!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,I call right nipple!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,That's shotgun on Optimus Prime.
2,23,Michael,"Look, this vehicle, which is decidedly not Optimus Prime has never been built before."
2,23,Michael,So I'll need a few days to do this.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, we just escaped by the skin of our teeth, and any second now, Shawn is gonna realize that we're not at Mindy St. Claire's."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So whatever this magical Good Place-mobile is, now's the time to whip it out, B!"
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,I agree.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,And although I believe I've asked you this already --
2,23,Michael,There is no business class.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, they're right."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,We gotta go.
2,23,Michael,"Oh okay, here goes nothing."
2,23,Michael,"Janet, if you would?"
2,23,Janet,And presto!
2,23,Michael,"Oops, forgot to log in first."
2,23,Michael,Gotta answer my security question.
2,23,Michael,"""What was the name of your childhood pet?"""
2,23,Michael,"Korzoff, the ten-headed dog-spider."
2,23,Janet,And presto!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Dope!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We did it, guys."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We won.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're going to the Good Place.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,In a frickin' gold balloon.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Shotgun!
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,It's a hot air balloon.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,What does that even mean?
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Top of the balloon!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Ultimate shotgun.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,So many memories of this place.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,"Eating frozen yogurt, and then having diarrhea, and then eating more frozen yogurt, and then more diarrhea."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Maybe I should've realized this wasn't the Good Place because of all the diarrhea.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe you shouldn't be eating all that frozen yogurt right now.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,We're about to be on a balloon.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you think our new home will be like?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm picturing Hawaiian beach, unlimited Mai Tais and a phone."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I miss my phone so much."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet I have so many texts.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just want us all to be together.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Separate houses, obviously."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Large lawns.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'd have a tasteful moat.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,I don't care where I live as long as they have more of this frozen yogurt.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,An unlimited library.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"All of my philosopher heroes walking around, waiting to be engaged in rigorous intellectual debate."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"And I hope that library is air-conditioned, because we are gonna be working up quite a sweat."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,And soulmates.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I hope they're real.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you know, for all of us."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I hope everyone gets someone special.
2,23,Janet,Good news.
2,23,Janet,We've got a handle on the controls.
2,23,Janet,Who's ready to go balloonin'?
2,23,Michael,"Okay, I think we figured it out."
2,23,Michael,"I pieced together this design from a number of ancient manuscripts, which Janet will now interpret for you."
2,23,Janet,"""The balloon will only transport those who have attained self-realization."
2,23,Janet,"Each traveler will step upon the scale, and her soul shall be weighed."
2,23,Janet,"If she is the best version of herself, it will permit her to board."
2,23,Janet,"If not, passage will be denied."""
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We got this.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know about you guys, but I am definitely the best version of myself."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know a shirt-ton about ethics now 'cause I studied.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I read books that weren't even written by the Real Housewives.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Relax, everyone."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're all gonna be fine.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't believe anything I was saying.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,In I go.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well
2,23,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip!"
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, nuts!"
2,23,Jason Mendoza,It's okay.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,The pattern is green-green-green-red.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Remember that when it starts up again/
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, everyone."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"I just have some worries, as well as some concerns, that could potentially turn into outright fears."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, there they go."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, they're fears now."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I know this mood."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come with us, Dr. Freakout."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was a joke.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're actually very good friends.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Here's the thing, that balloon wants us to be the best version of ourselves, but for the four of us, that's not just a metaphor."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,There have been literally 802 different versions of us.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,And how do I know that this version is the best version of myself?
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,How do I know it's not version number 85 or 322 or 558?
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Or 69 or 420!
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Then you get into the whole idea of consciousness.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,You just forget about best and what version of Chidi is even real?
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,What happens here?
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Does he eventually tire himself out?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Usually, but this one seems to be getting stronger as he goes on."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye, and this Chidi is an impostor.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This is pretty simple, bud."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've been our teacher this whole time.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We are much better because of you.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If we're the best versions of ourselves, which that balloon just proved, then you definitely are."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"So, in a way, it doesn't matter if I was better in version 492 or whatever because the best version of me is just as much about my effect on the world around me, as it is about my own egocentric self-image."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I really meant that much to you guys?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course you did.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus."
2,23,Michael,"Chidi, ready to try again?"
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah!
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,All right.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Ah!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Dope!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi got in my head.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's just that thing Chidi said about previous versions of myself, it's screwing me up."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I can fix it.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I stole this from your house the first night we were here.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Should be the best version of myself now.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, scale, be cool!"
2,23,Michael,"Guys, we're just not ready."
2,23,Michael,I think we should regroup and try again tomorrow.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hang on.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know the answer.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know why I'm not my best self.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you remember that version of me from the tape of us at Mindy's?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where I was vulnerable and emotional and honest?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That Eleanor is a better Eleanor than this one.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And that is not an easy thing for me to say.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""You're not better than me"" was my yearbook quote."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, can you tell us a little bit about that version?"
2,23,Michael,"Uh, reboot number 119."
2,23,Michael,All the restaurants were kebab places.
2,23,Michael,"You had a pet lizard, which I made poop on you all the time."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you tell us more about Chidi's and my relationship from that version?
2,23,Michael,Sorry.
2,23,Michael,You really got into ethics and you spent a lot of time together.
2,23,Michael,"Once, you handed him a tissue right before he sneezed, and that simple act of anticipating his needs made him fall for you."
2,23,Michael,"One night, you took a walk along the lake and you had your first kiss."
2,23,Michael,Which gross.
2,23,Michael,Kissing is gross.
2,23,Michael,You just mash your food holes together.
2,23,Michael,It's not for that.
2,23,Michael,"Anyway, it, uh it just, you know, bloomed after that."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, there are obviously some undealt-with issues here."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,I propose that everyone who is green go ahead and board the magic balloon and set out to the Good Place.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sort of like an advance team.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We'll put our names in or book a table, however it works, and then we'll send back the magical balloon for the red-light people later on."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a perfect plan.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's not working.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,It probably thinks I'm Eleanor.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It is I, Tahani."
2,23,Janet,"In case you were wondering, I am, by definition, the best version of myself because my operating system is always updating."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm not sure that's true, Janet."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,You still haven't talked to Jason about your romantic baggage.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the three of you are in some sort of weird love triangle.
2,23,Janet,You don't know what you're talking about.
2,23,Janet,"Also, love isn't a triangle."
2,23,Janet,It's a five-dimensional blob.
2,23,Janet,So
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you're so perfect, step on the scale."
2,23,Janet,Fine.
2,23,Janet,"Ooh, I think I broke it."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,My beautiful balloon scale!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's not yours!
2,23,Michael,"No, no."
2,23,Michael,"Please, stop fighting."
2,23,Michael,"Oh, man."
2,23,Michael,This stinks.
2,23,Michael,I'm having this feeling where what is it called?
2,23,Michael,You know where you did a thing and you're sad after it?
2,23,Michael,After-sad?
2,23,Michael,Is that no.
2,23,Michael,You humans have so many emotions!
2,23,Michael,"You only need two, anger and confusion!"
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, what's going on?"
2,23,Michael,The problem isn't any of you.
2,23,Michael,It this whole balloon thing is a fake.
2,23,Michael,The truth is I have no idea how to get into the Good Place and I never have.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, Michael's right."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm angry and confused.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"So, months ago, when you said you had this whole complicated plan for getting us to the Good Place --"
2,23,Michael,It was a lie.
2,23,Michael,"I assumed if I bought myself some time, I could figure out a way in."
2,23,Michael,"Guys, I tried a billion different ways."
2,23,Michael,Not an exaggeration.
2,23,Michael,I actually tried one billion and 12 different plans.
2,23,Michael,But the only way into the Good Place is by being a good person on Earth.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is unforgivable.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,How many times can you betray us?
2,23,Michael,I'm sorry.
2,23,Michael,I really am.
2,23,Michael,"Because while I was searching for a way to get in, I was also taking your ethics classes, learning why it was bad to lie."
2,23,Michael,"So not only did I fail at getting us into the Good Place, I also learned the error of my ways."
2,23,Michael,"Real rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell ya."
2,23,Michael,But this was not torture!
2,23,Michael,"I was stalling, so I could keep searching for a way in."
2,23,Michael,"I would've been happy if you were to live in this neighborhood forever, but then Shawn came and just ruined the whole thing."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,So what happens now?
2,23,Michael,"Shawn will eventually figure out you're not at Mindy's, and he'll realize that someone on the inside was helping you."
2,23,Michael,"So, you'll go to the real Bad Place forever, and I will be retired."
2,23,Michael,You're mad at me.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not mad.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just disappointed.
2,23,Michael,"Oh, come on, everyone knows that's worse."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, this really is the end."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Completely out of options, are we?"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not completely out of options.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can do what the Shellstrops have always done when the chips are down ignore our problems and drink heavily.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A million bottles of your finest booze, please!"
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,You all right?
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Kind of.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,I asked Michael if I could pop the giant balloon and he said no.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,"Then I asked if I could suck the helium out of it to make my voice sound funny so it cheers everyone up, and he just kind of sighed and walked away, so I guess that one is still on the table."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Are you and me cool?
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not exactly.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I think perhaps, given everything, it's best we end our relationship."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's probably about time I stopped relying on others for my sense of self-worth or happiness.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, my whole life, whenever I encountered any obstacles, I would simply say, ""I would like to speak to your manager."""
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But in our relationship, there is no manager."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"There is no one who can fix this for me, except me."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,My mom was a manager at a pet store.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Does that help?
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, and please don't launch into one of --"
2,23,Jason Mendoza,She got fired after I robbed
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, Jason."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please
2,23,Jason Mendoza,We actually robbed it together.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Please, stop."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,"Long story short, it was all a dream."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thank you, Jason, for making this moment a little easier for me."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, here's where I'm at."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Feelings are stupid.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Who needs them?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, uh, in case feelings aren't stupid, and in the case that we are eternally doomed, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I do have feelings for you."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I know you don't feel the same way.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And although that fills me with anger and confusion wow, Michael was right on the money."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just wanted you to know the truth.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"You are, I mean --"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, don't say anything."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't, don't."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I want to.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I want to.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Here's the thing about me.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,You know the sound that a fork makes in the garbage disposal?
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,That's the sound that my brain makes all the time.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Just this constant grinding about things I'm afraid of or things that I want or want to want, or want to want to want"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it grinding in there right now?
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, but the point is the circumstances under which we met are completely insane and that just makes the grinding harder."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"I wish we'd met the way normal people meet, like at a philosophy conference or after one of my philosophy lectures, or you came knocking on my office door, asking for help with philosophy."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is that how you think people meet?
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know how normal people meet.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're such a nerd.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Attention, everyone!"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We may not know exactly which version of ourselves was technically our best self, but you know what?"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I like who we are right now.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,To this version of us.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,To the good people we've all become.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Ooh, and to Eleanor, our unofficial leader."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,You pack a lot of heart and grit into that diminutive frame.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like a scrappy little auto mechanic.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me, babe, and I'll take it."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,And to Janet!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,The best robot.
2,23,Janet,Not a robot.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Girl.
2,23,Janet,Not a girl.
2,23,Jason Mendoza,And straight up hottie!
2,23,Janet,"I am attractive, yes."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Any of us could have ever asked for.
2,23,Janet,"Thanks, guys."
2,23,Janet,"Because of the way we were conceived of and created, Janets don't typically give speeches."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, she's done."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's not gonna give a speech.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, cool."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,One more toast.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,To Michael!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Michael!
2,23,All,Whoo!
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Who is easily the best version of himself.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Granted, the bar was low."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,He is a demon.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"But he made a mistake and admitted he was wrong, which makes him better than 90% of all humans."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you know what?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,It wasn't really Michael's fault.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,We weren't getting into the Good Place anyway.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, look at us."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A self-obsessed socialite, a ridiculous giraffe, an absurd British aristocrat, a narcissistic attention-seeker --"
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Are these all me?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, I was gonna do eight for you and one for everyone else."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, Michael, we forgive you."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, at least you tried to find a way to the Good Place."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,And that's the greatest thing someone can do.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just try your best.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we hereby name you an honorary human, and we would like to present you with this human starter kit."
2,23,Michael,Car keys.
2,23,Michael,"So I can lose them and say, ""Has anyone seen my car keys?"""
2,23,Michael,And then I can do that thing where you thank you!
2,23,Michael,"And Band-Aids, for your stupid fragile bodies."
2,23,Michael,"Oh, and look at this, a stress ball with a dumb corporate logo."
2,23,Michael,"Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this, and almost throw it away, and then think, ""No, I'll use it."""
2,23,Michael,"Oh, guys."
2,23,Michael,"A Dr. Oz diet book, because you're all such suckers."
2,23,Michael,This is all garbage that I have no real use for.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's right.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Welcome to being human.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,To Michael!
2,23,Michael,You don't remember?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,23,Michael,Of course you don't!
2,23,Janet,That's mean.
2,23,Michael,That was version one.
2,23,Janet,"Michael, there's a message coming in from Shawn."
2,23,Michael,"""Finish shutting everything down."
2,23,Michael,Sending train first thing tomorrow.
2,23,Michael,Humans will be captured and tortured soup.
2,23,Michael,"Sorry, autocorrect."
2,23,Michael,Soon.
2,23,Michael,"Although, weirdly, I did just finish turning someone into soup."
2,23,Michael,So random.
2,23,Michael,"Okay, bye."""
2,23,Jason Mendoza,What do you guys think the Bad Place is going to be for you?
2,23,Jason Mendoza,"I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert, and I'll be waiting for the bass drop."
2,23,Jason Mendoza,And it it'll never come.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For me, it'll be camping."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, I'll just always be camping."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm pretty good at turning every place I go into my personal hell, so I think they'll have a lot of options for me."
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mine will obviously be an eternity spent in the Swiss Alps.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds amazing.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,In autumn.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,The off-season.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, still fine."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'd be fine.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are we kidding?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,You'll be running the place in the week.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She'll be like, ""Oh, hibbledy-dibbledy, this simply won't do!"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I demand to speak to your manager."""
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Again!
2,23,Jason Mendoza,Again!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Your manager!"""
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course!
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's it.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,We should speak to the manager.
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Wait, you said that there was a judge who decides on disputes between the Good Place and the Bad Place, right?"
2,23,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Some sort of head honcho I could pace in front of and plead our case to, and maybe even wag a finger at disapprovingly?"
2,23,Michael,I thought about that.
2,23,Michael,It's a non-starter.
2,23,Michael,Judge rarely hears cases.
2,23,Michael,"And the only way to get to the Judge's office is through a portal, and we can never get to that."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,Why not?
2,23,Michael,"We'd have to walk through the actual Bad Place, in plain sight, without getting caught, reach and pass through the portal."
2,23,Michael,"Convince the Judge to hear us out, even though we didn't go through the proper channels, and then somehow win our unwinnable case."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's do it!
2,23,Michael,You're serious?
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah!
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do we have to lose?
2,23,Michael,All I've really ever wanted was to know what it feels like to be human.
2,23,Michael,And now we're going to do the most human thing of all.
2,23,Michael,Attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence and fail spectacularly!
2,23,Michael,Get up!
2,23,Michael,Get up!
2,23,Michael,Everyone!
2,23,Michael,Get rest tonight.
2,23,Michael,"First thing tomorrow, we're going to the Bad Place."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,We had a lot of good times together.
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,I'll see you in the next life.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Goodbye, clowns."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Goodbye, modernist architecture that I was too trashy to appreciate."
2,23,Chidi Anagonye,"Goodbye, house."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Goodbye, house."
2,23,Bad Janet,"What up, idiot?"
2,23,Bad Janet,This is the 8:22 express to Bad Place Headquarters.
2,23,Bad Janet,We'd like to begin the boarding process with our first-class fat dinks.
2,23,Bad Janet,And there is no overhead storage.
2,23,Bad Janet,"So if you have any bags, why don't you just go ahead and place them up your fat butts?"
2,23,Michael,"Sorry about this, Bad Janet."
2,23,Bad Janet,"Sorry about what, ya fat dink --"
2,23,Michael,Oh.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,This was your life's work.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay with leaving the fake Good Place behind?
2,23,Michael,"As long as I'm with you guys, I'm always in the fake Good Place."
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That doesn't sound as nice as you think it does.
2,23,Michael,The real Bad Place was the friends we made along the way.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nope.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still nonsense.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,One more try.
2,23,Michael,"In a way, the Good Place was inside the Bad Place all along?"
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's technically true.
2,23,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll give it to you.
2,23,Michael,I just made an aphorism.
2,23,Michael,"Hit it, Janet."
2,23,Michael,"Next stop, the actual Bad Place!"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You all right, chief?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,You look like you lost your lucky bookmark.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no!"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Did I?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,It's fine.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I got it right here.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"It's just that now that we're actually on the train, heading to Bad Place headquarters, this plan is starting to feel slightly completely insane."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,This is the only way to get to the Judge?
2,24,Michael,"I'm afraid so, yes."
2,24,Michael,"See, the Judge exists in a sort of neutral zone, separate from the Good Place and the Bad Place."
2,24,Michael,"The only things there are the Judge's quarters, the accounting department and the Janet Warehouse."
2,24,Michael,"No, there's also an IHOP."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Oh!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna order the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity!
2,24,Michael,"No, sorry, in this realm, IHOP stands for ""Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes""."
2,24,Michael,You don't really eat these pancakes.
2,24,Michael,It's more like they eat you.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"I'll get eggs, then."
2,24,Michael,"So, the only way to get to the Judge is through a portal, which is smack dab in the middle of the main office at Bad Place headquarters."
2,24,Michael,And the only way through the portal is with one of these.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,What is that?
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that jewelry?
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not that it matters.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's just some jewelry I don't have.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I have it?
2,24,Michael,These pins are hard to come by.
2,24,Michael,Only upper management-types have them.
2,24,Michael,"So, you guys will lay low while I get us four more."
2,24,Michael,"Janet doesn't need one because, for portals, she counts as a carry-on."
2,24,Janet,I'm luggage.
2,24,Michael,I had Janet make you each a Bad Place disguise.
2,24,Michael,And everyone who worked in the neighborhood has been sent back to their previous departments.
2,24,Michael,So the chances of you being recognized are very small.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I don't know.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,This plan seems complicated.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"To be fair, you once said that about an orange."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,They don't make sense.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Apples, you eat their clothes, but oranges, you don't?"
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Forget this plan.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I say we huck a Molotov cocktail and run through the portal.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I think we should go with Michael's plan.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Any time I had a problem, and I threw a Molotov cocktail boom, right away, I had a different problem."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,He makes a strong case.
2,24,Michael,"Okay, now you're all gonna need aliases."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna be Diana Tremaine.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was the name on my fake ID in high school.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Her address was 123 Whatever Street, Canada City, Canada."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Arizona bouncers are the best.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Character work.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such fun.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,I dabbled in a bit of acting after university.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Although mostly, I just stood around while Baz Luhrmann threw glitter on me."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I shall be Rhonda Mumps, and I work down at the hot dog factory."
2,24,Michael,You need to be more specific.
2,24,Michael,There are nine Hot Dog Torture Departments.
2,24,Michael,"Making people into, stuffing people with"
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Stuffing people sounds fun.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that shoving them into vegan's throats?
2,24,Michael,Yes throats.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I know what my secret identity is.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can't be Blake Bortles.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Fine.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Then I'll be Jake.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Don't say ""Jortles""."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Jortles!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I work in the Molotov Cocktail Department.
2,24,Michael,I thought you would be more worried about this.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,We've been knee-deep in demons for 800 reboots now.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lying about who we are is second nature.
2,24,Michael,Huh.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I hate this.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I hate lying.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,It's not permissible.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I can't do this.
2,24,Michael,"Oh, boy."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jeez Louise.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Looks like Chidi has a real case of the Mondays, am I right?"
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hey, pass the Nascar ketchup."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, if you don't wanna lie because it conflicts with your moral principles, I get it."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one's gonna be mad at you.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Really?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, dumbass."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm lying to you to make you feel better.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sometimes lying is awesome.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, I said ""dumbass""."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, cursing, how I've missed you."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear in front of a Judge who is going to judge us."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"What if I lie down here and I lose 12 points, then in front of the Judge I'm 12 points short?"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Or what if the Judge doesn't take our case because we lied to get there?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Kant says that lying is always wrong.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I follow that maxim.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you can't even lie to demons?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're trying to torture us!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're behind enemy lines!
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Principles aren't principles when you pick and choose when you're gonna follow them.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I won't lie about who I am.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I understand and am cool with it.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"You're lying, aren't you?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wanna strangle you.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,What even is this thing?
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I hate suits.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"They remind me of court, and going to court, and being my own lawyer against the advice of the judge in court, and getting immediately convicted in court."
2,24,Janet,I think you look nice.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I think you look sexy.
2,24,Janet,Here.
2,24,Janet,I got you this to help your disguise.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Whoa, a briefcase?"
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Take my credit card to the hedge fund.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I'll meet you at the martini store.
2,24,Janet,"Oh, you're gonna get caught."
2,24,Janet,Give me the briefcase back.
2,24,Janet,Thanks.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Aw.
2,24,Michael,"Janet, you need to get in character, too."
2,24,Michael,"I know you look like a Bad Janet, but can you act like one?"
2,24,Janet,I have gained a lot of new skills recently.
2,24,Janet,"For example, I learned how to be passive-aggressive."
2,24,Janet,Totally fine that you guys haven't noticed.
2,24,Michael,Oh.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's practice.
2,24,Janet,Okay.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll make a request, and you give me that patented Bad Janet attitude."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I have a glass of water?
2,24,Janet,Here you go.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's try again.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Be mean.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water?"
2,24,Janet,No.
2,24,Janet,"I would never give you that, you dumb person."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, what's that behind your back?"
2,24,Janet,Nothing.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give it to me.
2,24,Janet,It's a glass of water.
2,24,Michael,Oh.
2,24,Janet,And a backup glass.
2,24,Janet,"Oh, boy."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, boy."
2,24,Michael,Oh.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's okay, we'll keep working."
2,24,Janet,Okay.
2,24,Michael,We're here.
2,24,Announcer,All trains today are delayed by three hours.
2,24,Announcer,Just like they are every day.
2,24,Announcer,"All passengers, you all suck and you're ugly."
2,24,Michael,Keep walking.
2,24,Michael,Keep your heads down.
2,24,Michael,Just act unnatural.
2,24,Michael,"Hey, guys."
2,24,Michael,Wait here while I go get us some more of these pins.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,But what is this place?
2,24,Michael,It's just a place.
2,24,Michael,An area or location.
2,24,Michael,It's pretty straightforward.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"""The Museum of Human Misery""?"
2,24,Michael,"Oh, yeah."
2,24,Michael,It's a torture museum.
2,24,Michael,Famous examples of bad behavior and explanations of the torture they earned.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Is there a gift shop?
2,24,Michael,"Jason, this is hell."
2,24,Michael,Of course there's a gift shop.
2,24,Michael,It's the least horrifying room.
2,24,Michael,It's the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""First person to floss in an open-plan office""?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, she deserves to be tortured."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's a monster.
2,24,Michael,This was the safest place I could think of.
2,24,Michael,No one ever comes in here.
2,24,Michael,"Guys, if you do leave this room you'll see things that will haunt you for eternity."
2,24,Michael,"Okay, back soon."
2,24,Michael,Bye.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, hey!"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be careful.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
2,24,Michael,"""Be careful""?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,24,Michael,"Oh, Eleanor, are you worried about me?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I'm worried."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cause you're our ticket out of here, genius."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't go getting all goopy on me.
2,24,Michael,Worry about them.
2,24,Michael,I'll be fine.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""First man to send an unsolicited picture of his genitals."""
2,24,Animatronic Man,Heh.
2,24,Animatronic Man,Heh.
2,24,Animatronic Man,Heh.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"""First waiter to approach a diner with an empty plate and sarcastically say, 'I guess you hated it.'"""
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"""First white person to grow dreadlocks and first person to call Ultimate Frisbee 'Ultimate'!"""
2,24,Jason Mendoza,This dude rules!
2,24,Petruchio,"All right, we've got a lot of work to do."
2,24,Petruchio,Why don't you set up the bar over by that wall?
2,24,Bad Janet,"Why don't you roll off your mom and do it yourself, you fat dink?"
2,24,Petruchio,Set up more tables.
2,24,Petruchio,We're expecting a big crowd.
2,24,Janet,"You got it, you piece of butt."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Son of a bitch!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Still happy I can swear now, but everything else about this is very bad."
2,24,Michael,"Hey, boss."
2,24,Michael,I'm back.
2,24,Shawn,Welcome home.
2,24,Shawn,Axe up.
2,24,Michael,Ow!
2,24,Michael,New scent.
2,24,Michael,"""Transformers""."
2,24,Shawn,Yes.
2,24,Shawn,It makes you smell how Transformers movies make you feel.
2,24,Michael,Still can't believe those jack-offs got away.
2,24,Michael,Really zips my tip.
2,24,Shawn,Yeah.
2,24,Michael,"Anyway, I drew up some extradition papers to get them back from Mindy's."
2,24,Michael,"I'll take a few of my most trusted staff, hop in the portal, file those with the Judge, quick stop for pancakes, and then I'll head on back."
2,24,Michael,"By the way, I'm gonna need four pins for my crew."
2,24,Shawn,This is very thorough.
2,24,Shawn,However
2,24,Michael,Is that where we're putting top priority files nowadays?
2,24,Shawn,We won't need extradition papers.
2,24,Shawn,Plans are already in motion to get the humans back in a different way.
2,24,Michael,Ah.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, man, this is not good."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,This is not good!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can't stand here in a group.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Looks too conspicuous.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll go with Tahani.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, go with Jason."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason's unearned confidence lets him do all the talking and you don't have to lie.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Come on, Diana, let's hit the bar."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm gonna get me a tall glass of pipin' hot corn syrup and a scooter, so I can roll around the mall."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's really good.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
2,24,Petruchio,Hors d'oeuvre?
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, what do you got?"
2,24,Petruchio,"Soul food from Maine, bagels from Arkansas, Hawaiian pizza, of course, and egg salad from a hospital vending machine in Azerbaijan."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,That.
2,24,Petruchio,Have a terrible evening.
2,24,Chet,No way!
2,24,Chet,Trent?
2,24,Chet,Is that you?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, who else could it be?"
2,24,Chet,"Come on, tap it out."
2,24,Chet,"Boom, boom."
2,24,Chet,What's up?
2,24,Chet,I'm Chet.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Jake is my name, Molotov cocktails is my game."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I think school is lame.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I got a tattoo of David Blaine!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,What!
2,24,Chet,Whoo!
2,24,Chet,Tight!
2,24,Chet,Ball tap!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Dip!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Ball tap!
2,24,Chet,Ow!
2,24,Chet,"That's a firm ball tap, bro."
2,24,Chet,"Anyway, your boy Trent and I worked together in Partial Decapitations."
2,24,Chet,When did you leave Decap?
2,24,Chet,800 years ago?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Something like that.
2,24,Chet,"I just joined a new department, Toxic Masculinity."
2,24,Chet,"We torture Internet trolls, frat dudes."
2,24,Chet,It actually started as a training program to prep for when the Girls Gone Wild dude gets here.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Joe Francis?
2,24,Chet,The one.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Legend!
2,24,Chet,"Bro-hams, get over here and meet my top dog, Trent."
2,24,Chet,Dude's a straight beast when it comes to torture.
2,24,Dirk,"Sup, bro?"
2,24,Chork,"Sup, bro?"
2,24,Chet,It's pretty choice that we're running into you right now.
2,24,Chet,"My top dog, Dirk, here, he got stuck with a new case."
2,24,Chet,He can't crack it.
2,24,Chet,"Hit 'em with it, D-money."
2,24,Dirk,"I'm trying to torture this guy, Brant."
2,24,Dirk,Brant was a total lord.
2,24,Dirk,"He got kicked off of Rob Gronkowski's party cruise for throwing a lobster at a stripper, and then he died doing a keg stand in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler."
2,24,Chet,"Anyways, we run a couple hundred torture scenarios."
2,24,Chet,None of them seemed quite right.
2,24,Chet,Think we can get you to crack this nut?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, how can I say no?"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I know how I would say no."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"I'd be all like, ""No!"""
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,But I can't.
2,24,Chet,"You're so weird, Trent, man."
2,24,Chet,You're always so weird.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
2,24,Chet,I love that about you.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Don't get me wrong, I love shoving hot dogs into people, but once you've dogged every hole, you just start to feel like you're repeating yourself."
2,24,Megan,"I hear that, sister."
2,24,Megan,I'm gonna go take a dump.
2,24,Megan,You want me to grab you one?
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Nah, I'm good, thanks."
2,24,Megan,Not even a little nugg?
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Nah, I'm a'ight."
2,24,Megan,All right.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Damn, you're good at this."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hang out with Johnny Depp enough, you become pretty good at lying."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Like, ""No, your whole thing isn't exhausting at all!"""
2,24,Janet,"Hi, there you big, stinky, poop-face guys."
2,24,Janet,"It's me, Good Janet."
2,24,Janet,"I'm sorry I called you big, stinky, poop-face guys."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's okay.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can you dig around a little bit and find out what this event is and how long it's gonna last?"
2,24,Janet,I'd love to.
2,24,Janet,Punch your teeth!
2,24,Janet,Hey.
2,24,Janet,Hi.
2,24,Janet,Teeth.
2,24,Janet,Ugh.
2,24,Michael,What's all this?
2,24,Shawn,I was going to try to get the humans back by going through the proper channels.
2,24,Shawn,But then I remembered I'm a naughty bitch.
2,24,Shawn,"So, I sent a black ops team to Mindy's, to extract them."
2,24,Michael,Nobody from the Bad Place is allowed in Mindy's neighborhood.
2,24,Michael,"You can't do that, Shawn."
2,24,Michael,It's illegal.
2,24,Shawn,"Oh, no."
2,24,Shawn,"Guys, Michael says this is illegal."
2,24,Shawn,I hadn't thought of that.
2,24,Shawn,That was sarcasm.
2,24,Shawn,I had thought of that.
2,24,Shawn,"Listen, your experiment blew up in our faces."
2,24,Shawn,"The example I made of Vicky ensured everybody kept their mouths shut, but we're not out of the woods until those four are back in custody."
2,24,Shawn,So I rounded up some loyal friends and took matters into my own hands.
2,24,Val,"Relax, Mike."
2,24,Val,This will all be over soon and we can all head down to the museum.
2,24,Michael,The museum?
2,24,Shawn,Yes.
2,24,Shawn,"Your neighborhood, our neighborhood, is being immortalized for its success."
2,24,Shawn,It's all gonna work out.
2,24,Shawn,I took the form of a 45-year-old white man for a reason.
2,24,Shawn,I can only fail up.
2,24,Shawn,The team is in place.
2,24,Shawn,Let's do this.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"So, those bro demons over there think I'm some kind of great torturer, and they want my advice on how to torture someone."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Jason is stalling by ranking MMA ring girls with them, but I have to do something."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Help me!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know the answer, dude."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lie your ass off.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Rhonda can do it, you can."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,I once shoved a hot dog right down the throat of the legendary John Wayne.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,She even name-drops in hell.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"I told you, lies have consequences!"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"I will have contributed to someone's eternal torture, because I disobeyed a basic Kantian moral principle."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna be sick.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I don't wanna go back to the bathroom.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,They put mirrors in the toilet.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,That makes you really confront what you're doing!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sit down.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Take a breath.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Rub your lucky bookmark.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hear me out.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,What if lying is ethical in this situation?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What if certain actions aren't universally good or bad, like Jonathan Dancy says?"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Jonathan Dancy?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Are you talking about moral particularism?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,We never even covered that.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,You read on your own?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,You think just because I'm a straight hottie I can't read philosophy for fun?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I --
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, moral particularism says there are no fixed rules that work in every situation."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, let's say you promised your friend you'd go to the movies, but then your mom suddenly gets rushed to the ER."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Your boy, Kant, would say, ""Never break a promise."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Go see Chronicles of Riddick.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely and steals a bucket of Vicodin from the nurse's closet."""
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Real example?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yep.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,But a moral particularist like me I'm one now.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just decided.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Would say, ""There's no absolute rule."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You have to choose your actions based on the particular situation."""
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Right now, we are in a pretty bonkers situation."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I don't think I can change what I believe just like that.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I didn't think I would ever be at a cocktail party in literal hell lecturing my teacher/ex-lover about moral particularism, but life throws you curveballs, bro!"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And need I remind you, it was doing things your way that made you end up here."
2,24,Chet,Man!
2,24,Chet,"Get back over there, dog!"
2,24,Chet,Damn.
2,24,Chet,You got that good stank.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Back at you, bud."
2,24,Chet,Smash you later.
2,24,Chet,Let's roll.
2,24,Janet,"Hey, butt ass!"
2,24,Janet,Butt-ass.
2,24,Janet,How long is this stupid event supposed to last anyway?
2,24,Petruchio,"They're unveiling the exhibit in ten minutes, then everyone'll get drunk and poke each other with hot sticks, and then it'll be over."
2,24,Janet,Farts.
2,24,Janet,Uh-oh.
2,24,Shawn,Bad Janet?
2,24,Shawn,Walkie-talkie mode.
2,24,Operative,Now entering Mindy St. Claire's house.
2,24,Val,This is so exciting!
2,24,Val,I hope everyone gets hurt!
2,24,Operative,Living room is clear.
2,24,Operative,Entering the bedroom.
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,"Oh, yeah!"
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,Ow!
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,Oh!
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,God!
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,This feels so weird.
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,Here we go.
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,Do some coke off my butt!
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,Wait!
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
2,24,Mindy St. Claire,Who are you guys?
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, friends!"
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,"Hi, I'm Derek."
2,24,Shawn,Where are the humans?
2,24,Shawn,And who is Derek?
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,Me is Derek.
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,These are my wind chimes.
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, oh, oh."
2,24,Derek Hofstetler,My wind chimes like you.
2,24,Operative,The only people here are Mindy St. Claire and an unknown male with a genital deformity.
2,24,Operative,The four humans are not here.
2,24,Shawn,Where is Michael?
2,24,Michael,"Oh, boy!"
2,24,Michael,"Oh, boy!"
2,24,Lance,"Hey, there, Mike."
2,24,Michael,Oh!
2,24,Michael,"Hey, Lance."
2,24,Michael,"Looking good, buddy!"
2,24,Michael,Lose some weight?
2,24,Lance,I wish!
2,24,Shawn,"Listen up, people."
2,24,Shawn,"We need to find Michael, and we need to be discreet."
2,24,Shawn,"You, search from the Spastic Dentistry Department, down through Disembowelment."
2,24,Shawn,"You, cover Children's Dance Recitals through Holiday Weekend IKEA."
2,24,Shawn,Go.
2,24,Chet,"Hey, hey, hey!"
2,24,Chet,Found him.
2,24,Chet,He was birddogging some tail.
2,24,Dirk,"What you got for me, Trent?"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, peep this, dog."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,You really want to torture this dirtbag?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,You give him books.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I'm serious.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"This one time I was assigned this chick that I had to torture, and I just couldn't figure it out."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,And then I realized she hated books.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"So I just gave her mad books to read, around the clock."
2,24,Chet,"The books, like, exploded?"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,They were just regular moral philosophy books.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Everyone hates moral philosophers.
2,24,Chet,That is true.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"I know it's wild, but sometimes you gotta think outside the bun."
2,24,Dirk,Sick Taco Bell ref.
2,24,Chet,Very nice!
2,24,Dirk,"But I don't know, man."
2,24,Dirk,It sounds kind of lame.
2,24,Dirk,This guy's the best?
2,24,Dirk,Really?
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, maybe I don't know what I'm talking ball tap!"
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"That's what you get for questioning Trent, the torture master!"
2,24,Jason Mendoza,He got you so bad!
2,24,Dirk,"Yeah, he did."
2,24,Dirk,He did.
2,24,Dirk,"Nice job, bro."
2,24,Dirk,"All right, you've convinced me."
2,24,Dirk,I'll give him books.
2,24,Janet,"Hey, you two."
2,24,Janet,Get your ugly necks over here.
2,24,Janet,"Guys, I found something very bad."
2,24,Janet,We have to get out of here right now.
2,24,Bertram Varmin,"All right. everybody, gather around."
2,24,Bertram Varmin,This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,What do we do?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just don't draw attention.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whatever this is it'll be over in a second.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can sneak out the door.
2,24,Bertram Varmin,Feast your eyes on the newest exhibit here at The Museum of Human Misery.
2,24,Bertram Varmin,The residents of Neighborhood 12358W.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that what they think my hair looks like?
2,24,Bertram Varmin,This game-changing experiment chose four humans and had them torture each other.
2,24,Bertram Varmin,It's already led to major breakthroughs in the future of our industry.
2,24,Bertram Varmin,"Obviously, we couldn't get the actual four idiots as they're off being tortured, so we cooked up the next best thing."
2,24,Bertram Varmin,Wanna meet them?
2,24,Audience,Yeah!
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm Tahani Al-Jamil, a vainglorious attention-seeker, with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's underwater mansion, which I've been to, by the way."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I have, actually."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's remarkable.
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's remarkable.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I'm Chidi Anagonye.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Or maybe I'm not.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I can't decide anything.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Or maybe I can.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Ah.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,I can't decide.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,My stomach hurts.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,They kinda nailed it.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've heard you say all that stuff.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I mock others to distract myself from the emptiness inside me.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a fair hit.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,I'm Jason Mendoza.
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Duh!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,That's me.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, where've you been?"
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, how do you smell loud and confusing?"
2,24,Michael,No time to explain.
2,24,Michael,We gotta go.
2,24,Michael,I got the travel pins.
2,24,Chet,"Yo, that looks like my boy Trent."
2,24,Megan,And isn't that Rhonda Mumps?
2,24,Michael,Come on!
2,24,Shawn,There he is.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Uh-oh!
2,24,Shawn,And he's got the humans with him.
2,24,Michael,"All right, let's just back up here."
2,24,Tahani Al-Jamil,What do we do?
2,24,Jason Mendoza,This!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Jortles!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Go!
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, Eleanor, thanks for the advice."
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,It was helpful.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Even though I had to say a lot of words I don't like, like ""douche"", ""chick"" and ""peep this""."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,No problem.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm focused on running right now.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,"Right, I'm sorry!"
2,24,Michael,Here.
2,24,Michael,Put the pins on your lapels.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,24,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, you didn't give me a pin, man."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't have one.
2,24,Michael,"Okay, hang on."
2,24,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, where's Janet?"
2,24,Michael,No time to wait for her.
2,24,Michael,You three go.
2,24,Michael,Now.
2,24,Michael,Now!
2,24,Jason Mendoza,Portals!
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Any day now, man!"
2,24,Shawn,Hey!
2,24,Michael,"Hey, guess what?"
2,24,Michael,I just solved the Trolley Problem.
2,24,Michael,Remember?
2,24,Michael,The thought experiment where you're driving the trolley and you can either plow into a group of people or turn and hit one person?
2,24,Michael,I solved it.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's really great.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I don't think now's the time --
2,24,Michael,The Trolley Problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die.
2,24,Michael,And the actual solution is very simple.
2,24,Michael,You sacrifice yourself.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does that mean?
2,24,Michael,You look after the others.
2,24,Michael,They need you.
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
2,24,Shawn,Step away from the portal!
2,24,Michael,"Goodbye, Eleanor."
2,24,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, wait, wait!"
2,24,Michael,"Hey, boss."
2,24,Michael,What's up?
2,25,Jason Mendoza,That was awesome!
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'm going again!
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,I think I barfed in the nether-dimension before we landed.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Is my barf just gonna float out there forever?
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Will someone fly through my barf when they use the portal?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, stop saying ""barf""."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,And where's Michael?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not coming.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,He sacrificed himself to save me.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,The last thing I saw was Shawn grabbing him.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Was it a nice grab or a bad grab?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,A bad grab.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Like a nice bad grab or a mean bad grab?
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,No Michael and no Janet.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Didn't even get to say a proper goodbye.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not even a mere toodle-oo.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're on our own.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to handle this ourselves.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael said the portal would lead us to the Judge, so where's the Judge?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,All I see is a burrito.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Do you think it's a test?
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, maybe one of us is supposed to eat it, or we eat it together, or maybe it's a test to see how long we can go without eating it."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'm not scared of any burrito.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'll eat it.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Unless the burrito is the Judge.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Judges aren't food.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Judges are serious people, who wear long silk nightgowns and big white powdered wigs."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ah-ah!
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,He could be right.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Really?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just saying we've certainly seen weirder things than an all-knowing burrito.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can't take any chances.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, Your Excellency."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We doth seek thine judgement.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We've traveled a long distance to see you, O Great One."
2,25,Judge,What are you guys looking at?
2,25,Judge,Hi.
2,25,Judge,I'm the Judge.
2,25,Judge,That's a burrito.
2,25,Judge,"What's up, guys?"
2,25,Judge,"Yeah, I did not think I had a case today."
2,25,Judge,The paperwork should have shown up by now.
2,25,Judge,"Unless you guys just, like, came here."
2,25,Judge,"Wait, did you guys just come here?"
2,25,Judge,"Oh, my God."
2,25,Judge,You guys are bad.
2,25,Judge,Which one is the worst one of you?
2,25,Judge,"Is it you, Glasses?"
2,25,Judge,"Oh, I bet it's you."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, yeah, we did just sort of ""show up"", but we had to."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We were escaping the Bad Place.
2,25,Judge,Mmm-hmm.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Which, now that I think about it, there might be some demons following us."
2,25,Judge,Don't worry about that.
2,25,Judge,"Any time anyone shows up in my chambers, the portal is sealed until I issue my ruling."
2,25,Judge,So you guys can relax.
2,25,Judge,Get comfortable.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,A classic St. Crispin's Day garden party frock.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Wait, is it after 4:00 p.m.?"
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not important.
2,25,Judge,Let's have a look at your files.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, you don't already know everything about us?"
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,You're not omniscient?
2,25,Judge,"Well, not in the way you mean."
2,25,Judge,"I try to learn as little as I can about the events of humankind, so I can remain impartial, 'cause I'm a judge."
2,25,Judge,"Yadda, yadda, yadda."
2,25,Judge,"That being said, sometimes I get bored and I cheat a little bit."
2,25,Judge,I've been bingeing Ken Burns' Vietnam recently.
2,25,Judge,It's okay.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, I'm immortal, but that thing is long."
2,25,Judge,You know what I'm saying?
2,25,Judge,"Anyway, your petition is denied."
2,25,Judge,I can't hear your case.
2,25,Judge,Please exit to the rear.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,25,Judge,"I just absorbed the entirety of your existences, and I just wanna say, you guys are so cute."
2,25,Judge,"And the thing is, you didn't file any paperwork, and you have no advocate, and the rules say I gotta send you back."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Your Honor, please hear our case."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,You frankly wouldn't believe what we've been through just to be here today.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, I would, because I just learned everything about you, but keep talking."
2,25,Judge,"I am, like, obsessed with your accent."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We have made so much progress, and all we ask is an audience with you to prove it."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is that not your very purpose?
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,To weigh in on matters such as ours?
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"To paraphrase a song written by my godfather, ""Hey, Judge, don't make it bad."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Take a sad group and make us better."""
2,25,Judge,"Say ""aluminum""."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Aluminum.
2,25,Judge,"""Alumin"""
2,25,Judge,I love that!
2,25,Judge,And I love your passion.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, it takes a lot of guts to just show up here unannounced."
2,25,Judge,"Plus, I haven't had a case in, like, 30 years and I'm super bored."
2,25,Judge,"So it's either this or start Bloodline and, I don't know, I just don't feel like I can see Kyle Chandler as anyone else but Coach Taylor."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the case?"
2,25,Judge,Right!
2,25,Judge,Let's do it.
2,25,Shawn,You had one job: torture four bad people forever.
2,25,Shawn,"Not only did you fail, you're a traitor."
2,25,Janet,"You really junked your jeans on this one, you butterface."
2,25,Michael,I did what I had to do.
2,25,Janet,"Oh, you had to junk your jeans?"
2,25,Shawn,How could you betray your own kind like this?
2,25,Shawn,Who taught you how to turn a human inside out by reaching down their throat and grabbing their butt from the inside?
2,25,Michael,You did.
2,25,Shawn,"You got that right, sister."
2,25,Shawn,And this is how you repay me.
2,25,Michael,"Oh, spare me the sanctimonious lecture."
2,25,Michael,You never cared about me.
2,25,Michael,"In the words of one of my actual friends, ""You're basic."""
2,25,Michael,It's a human insult.
2,25,Michael,It's devastating.
2,25,Michael,You're devastated right now.
2,25,Michael,"The point is, the four of them are in front of the Judge."
2,25,Michael,And the Good Janet has escaped too.
2,25,Michael,You'll never find her.
2,25,Janet,"Oh, you mean this Good Janet?"
2,25,Janet,"I found her in, like, two seconds."
2,25,Janet,"She was wondering the halls, being polite to people, like a chump."
2,25,Janet,So I marbleized her.
2,25,Janet,Keep her if you want.
2,25,Janet,Maybe shove it up your weiner for safekeeping.
2,25,Janet,I don't know.
2,25,Janet,It's up to you.
2,25,Judge,"I'm going to give each of you a test to see how much progress you've made, and if I deem you fit to be in the Good Place, then zoop!"
2,25,Judge,Up you go!
2,25,Judge,"Well, actually, sort of, that way."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can we be tested together as a group?
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, we all need to be able to cheat off Chidi."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, that's why your name is Chidi."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I get it now.
2,25,Judge,"I'm sorry, cuties."
2,25,Judge,The tests have to be individual.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, can we be graded as a group then?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,The only reason we've come this far is because we've helped each other.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I don't think anything's gonna feel like the Good Place if we're not together.
2,25,Judge,"So, if you all pass, you're in."
2,25,Judge,"And if even one of you fails, you're all effed, right?"
2,25,Judge,Terrible idea.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, truly awful."
2,25,Judge,"You are very lucky that I cannot send you to the Bad Idea Place, because that one is a stanker."
2,25,Judge,But whatever blows your dress up.
2,25,Judge,Am I right?
2,25,Judge,Jason.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Present!
2,25,Judge,Good.
2,25,Judge,In front of you is a video game system loaded with Madden football.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Are you kidding me?
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'm the best at Madden.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I call Jaguars!
2,25,Judge,"As I was about to tell you, you can only play against the Jaguars"
2,25,Jason Mendoza,No.
2,25,Judge," using their archrivals, the Tennessee Titans."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,No!
2,25,Judge,If you play the game and you lose --
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Oh!
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna win.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"Say no more, scary judge lady."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Tell my friends their souls are in good hands.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,No!
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I fumbled the kickoff!
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Titans suck!
2,25,Judge,Tahani.
2,25,Judge,It's such a pretty name.
2,25,Judge,My name is super boring.
2,25,Judge,Gen.
2,25,Judge,"Which is short for ""hydrogen"", which was the only thing that was in existence when I was born."
2,25,Judge,"Anyhoo, all you have to do is go through there, walk down the hallway and through the red door at the end."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's it?
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's my test?
2,25,Judge,Yup.
2,25,Judge,"Oh, also, everyone in every room that you pass is going to be discussing what they truly think about you."
2,25,Judge,"Okay, have fun!"
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I see."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a test of my ability to not care what other people think of me.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no!"
2,25,Shawn,"So, just to be clear, you actually rebooted them over 800 times, and all of these reports of their torture are completely fake?"
2,25,Michael,Yes.
2,25,Michael,"But, frankly, this is on you."
2,25,Michael,A lot of those details I just took directly from Stephen King novels and episodes of Pretty Little Liars.
2,25,Shawn,Just tell me why.
2,25,Shawn,Why would you do this?
2,25,Michael,It's not like I planned it!
2,25,Michael,I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other.
2,25,Michael,"Instead, they helped each other and got better."
2,25,Michael,They were bad people.
2,25,Michael,This is not supposed to be possible.
2,25,Michael,"So, the only explanation is that somehow, there was a mistake made, and these people belong in the Good Place."
2,25,Shawn,"No, they don't, idiot."
2,25,Michael,"Shawn, this is not fair."
2,25,Shawn,"""Fair"" is the stupidest word humans ever invented."
2,25,Shawn,"Except for ""staycation""."
2,25,Janet,Ew.
2,25,Michael,"Look, those four humans are good people, and they deserve a staycation in the Good Place."
2,25,Michael,And I bet the Judge will feel the same way.
2,25,Shawn,I doubt she even hears their case.
2,25,Shawn,"But if she does, one of them will screw it up."
2,25,Shawn,They always do.
2,25,Janet,"I'm sick of smelling this guy's lumpy, white ass."
2,25,Janet,Can we get rid of him already?
2,25,Shawn,"Yeah, it's time."
2,25,Shawn,Follow me.
2,25,Judge,"Okay, Eleanor and Chidi."
2,25,Judge,Looks like you guys are up.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,At the same time?
2,25,Judge,Yup.
2,25,Judge,"Trippy, right?"
2,25,Judge,There is no test.
2,25,Judge,You guys are in!
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're ""in""?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does that mean?
2,25,Judge,You've made great strides and you've made it to the Good Place.
2,25,Judge,Congrats.
2,25,Judge,"Take these medallions, go right through that portal and you're in there in a jiff."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,We made it.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,We made it.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We made it.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy crap!
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Whoo!
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,All those ethics lessons paid off.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoever said philosophy was stupid?
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,You did!
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Many times.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,As recently as this morning.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,But you also worked really hard and you deserve this.
2,25,Judge,You really do.
2,25,Judge,"Here's the thing, though."
2,25,Judge,It's just the two of you.
2,25,Judge,Tahani and Jason didn't make it.
2,25,Judge,I'm giving them tests right now to determine where they belong within the Bad Place.
2,25,Judge,"So, you might wanna reconsider that judge-us-together thing, 'cause if you stick to that, you're all going down."
2,25,Judge,I am so hungry.
2,25,Judge,Why am I so hungry?
2,25,Judge,"Oh, I'm such an idiot."
2,25,Judge,I forgot to eat my burrito.
2,25,Judge,And I was so hungry too.
2,25,Judge,What a dork.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, obviously, this is the test, right?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani the same offer and whichever couple takes it actually loses, and the other two get in for real."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, diabolical."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Judge, we figured out what --"
2,25,Judge,Nope!
2,25,Judge,Tahani and Jason have not been given the same offer.
2,25,Judge,"Here, take a look."
2,25,Judge,Tahani's test is to walk down a hallway and not get tempted by her gossiping friends.
2,25,Judge,Jason is playing video games.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, cool."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, I feel weird saying this to an almighty Judge, but you have hot sauce on your chin."
2,25,Judge,Thank you.
2,25,Judge,It's actually not hot sauce.
2,25,Judge,"It's envy, or the concept of envy."
2,25,Judge,It's really good on Mexican food.
2,25,Judge,It gives it a little kick.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, so what do we do?"
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That was your ""moral quandary"" grimace, which is different from your ""gas pain"" grimace and different from your ""someone said 'from whence it came' instead of 'whence it came'"" grimace."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, spit it out, man!"
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"If this isn't a test, then it's something way worse."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,A choice!
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,That we have to make.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you know, why can't one part of the calculation of our eternal fate be easy?"
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Quevenzhane Wallis and Stephen Hawking, in the same room, discussing me?"
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Guess they must have made up.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Focus.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,There'll be Fergies aplenty in the Good Place.
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,I don't know where we went wrong with Tahani.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,I know.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,She is such a disappointment compared to her sister.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Father."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Mother."
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,Oh.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Hello, Tahani."
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,We were just talking about how you're a huge disappointment compared to your sister.
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,Have a seat.
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,We'd love to get your take.
2,25,Judge,How's it going in here?
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I'm losing by three.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Meditating to calm myself down.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"I'd be winning by, like, a million if I could play as the Jags, instead of against them."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,I hate scoring against my own favorite team.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,But you already knew that because this is the test!
2,25,Judge,"Yeah, that's not a revelation or something."
2,25,Judge,I explained that very clearly.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"It's nice to see you, Tahani."
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Apparently, wherever you've been, they've been keeping you well-fed."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I've actually risked quite a lot to be in this room right now, so if you could just not be cruel for 30 seconds, that would be lovely."
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,Apologies.
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,It's been a while since we've seen you.
2,25,Waqas Al-Jamil,We have so much to tell you about your sister.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,We've just heard the most wonderful news.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,Kamila dedicated her last album to you.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Really?
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Well, she dedicated it to her fans and you're one of her fans."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The whole point of this afterlife test is that everyone in these rooms is supposed to be talking about me and yet, even in this scenario, you are still talking about Kamilah."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Which is exactly the point.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was never going to be enough for you, never going to earn your respect."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, I have done things that you would never have approved of."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,I died dressed as someone in the service industry.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,I shagged a Floridian.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,I even ate a Cheeto.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's right.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Chewing it was deafening and it's the happiest I have ever been.
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Don't get upset, dear."
2,25,Manisha Al-Jamil,"You barely fit in that dress and I'm afraid you're going to ""Hulk out"", as it were."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry we didn't have a better relationship and I wish you both the best.
2,25,Shawn,"All right, idiot, any last words?"
2,25,Michael,Go ahead and retire me already.
2,25,Shawn,"You're not getting retired, Michael."
2,25,Michael,I'm not?
2,25,Shawn,No.
2,25,Shawn,Retirement is a spectacle.
2,25,Shawn,Everyone would see the flaming ladles go down your throat.
2,25,Shawn,"Everyone would hear your eternal shrieks of agony, blah-blah-blah."
2,25,Shawn,Then they'd ask me what you did.
2,25,Shawn,I don't need that scrutiny right now.
2,25,Shawn,"So, I'm just going to throw you in this unmarked room for the rest of eternity."
2,25,Shawn,"And, since it seems you love humans so much, I'll torture you like one."
2,25,Shawn,All you'll have for entertainment is that giant stack of New Yorker magazines.
2,25,Michael,"Oh, come on."
2,25,Michael,You and I both know I'll never read those.
2,25,Shawn,Of course you won't.
2,25,Shawn,But they'll just keep coming.
2,25,Shawn,"Goodbye, Michael."
2,25,Shawn,We will leave you with one of Bad Janet's classic farts.
2,25,Shawn,The smell will linger for ten million years.
2,25,Janet,"All right, here comes the boom!"
2,25,Janet,"Oh, wait."
2,25,Janet,"Actually, before I absolutely let it rip, I just have one more thing I have to do."
2,25,Shawn,What?
2,25,Janet,It's me!
2,25,Janet,Good Janet!
2,25,Michael,Janet!
2,25,Michael,I thought you were a marble.
2,25,Janet,That was a trick!
2,25,Janet,"I realized if we wanted our friends to have any chance of survival, I had to learn how to do a lot of bad things really quickly."
2,25,Janet,So I did!
2,25,Janet,Now I'm ready to go back to being nice again.
2,25,Shawn,What happened?
2,25,Janet,"Okay, now I'll be nice again."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Could you please stop doing that?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,It helps me think.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We've been through every argument: Contractualist, Kantian, ""What would Superman do?"", ""What would Rihanna do?"""
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are we missing anything?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hit me, right now, with your most obscure, boring-est, ""old white dude with a long wizard beard"" mumbo jumbo."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, our friends are going to the Bad Place and us choosing to go with them won't lessen their suffering."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"So, morally, we're allowed to go."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,But let's forget about the ethics for a second.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"After everything that's happened, don't we deserve to be together?"
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"And happy, for once?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Judge?
2,25,Judge,Have you made your decision?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're not going to the Good Place.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, that was never actually an option, but for the sake of your test, we're not going."
2,25,Judge,What do you mean?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I was 99% sure that going was the wrong move, but, since our whole relationship has been me being sure of something and Chidi explaining why I was wrong, I owed it to him to quadruple-check."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,The capper came when I realized that ain't Chidi.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The Chidi I know wouldn't argue that he should be rewarded while his friends got punished and he would never ""forget about ethics for a second""."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know who this joker is, but it's not Chidi Anagonye."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, but what about the --"
2,25,Judge,"Well done, Eleanor."
2,25,Judge,You can take a seat and wait for the others.
2,25,Judge,Can I have that medallion back?
2,25,Judge,Cause it's actually a coaster for my sodas.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Where is the real Chidi, though?"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he okay?
2,25,Judge,He's still taking his test.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, this is ridiculous."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Um I'm just gonna choose brown.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Gray's the obvious choice, which is probably why I shouldn't choose it."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Brown.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Nope.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Gray.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Nope.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Brown.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Brown hat.
2,25,Judge,All right.
2,25,Judge,Fun stuff?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
2,25,Judge,Yeah?
2,25,Judge,Feeling good?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I think so, yes."
2,25,Judge,Great.
2,25,Judge,You're all going to the Bad Place.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"Um if I was the one who failed, could you at least tell me why I failed, for my own edification?"
2,25,Judge,It took you 82 minutes to choose a hat.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,But did I at least choose the right one?
2,25,Judge,There is no right one.
2,25,Judge,They're hats.
2,25,Judge,"Come on, man!"
2,25,Judge,Ugh!
2,25,Judge,"Tahani, you skipped a lot of rooms that I thought would entice you, but you weren't supposed to open any doors and you couldn't resist confronting your parents."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, everyone."
2,25,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But now that I failed, can I go back in and talk to Winston Churchill and Freddie Mercury?"
2,25,Judge,No.
2,25,Judge,"Jason, your test was about impulse control and you showed great improvements."
2,25,Judge,But you never asked if you could opt not to play.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, you basically told me, an all-knowing Judge, to just shut up and go away."
2,25,Judge,Do you realize how insane that is?
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"Not as insane as picking off the greatest quarterback of all time, Blake Bortles, to set up a last-second game-winning field goal."
2,25,Judge,"Now, Eleanor's test was about her selfishness, and she actually --"
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,I failed.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I shoved an old lady down the stairs to get to the raw bar, because I'm a shrimp fiend."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we all failed."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's not dwell on it.
2,25,Judge,All right.
2,25,Judge,Shall we?
2,25,Judge,"Oh, I am gonna miss you guys."
2,25,Judge,I made a little video of our time together.
2,25,Judge,"Look, there we are."
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, I thought I'd have a stomachache right now, but weirdly I do."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's my guy.
2,25,Chidi Anagonye,What?
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Doesn't matter.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm gonna miss you, bud."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Every time they pull my eyeballs out through my mouth, I'll think of you."
2,25,Judge,I'm gonna frame that one.
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"We gave it our best shot, guys."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,"I say we go through the portal, get a good night's sleep, come back fresh in the morning, try again."
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Jason, I feel like you always understand about 20% of what's happening."
2,25,Jason Mendoza,Thanks.
2,25,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
2,25,Judge,"I mean, look at us."
2,25,Judge,Good times.
2,25,Judge,"All right, off to eternal damnation."
2,25,Judge,Do you hear something?
2,25,Michael,Oh!
2,25,Michael,"Hey, guys!"
2,25,Michael,How you been?
3,26,Judge,"So, Michael, you're saying there's a new angle I should consider in this case?"
3,26,Judge,Love that.
3,26,Judge,Major drama.
3,26,Judge,"Spill the tea, sweetheart."
3,26,Michael,The premise of our system is that a person's score during her time on Earth is final and inarguable.
3,26,Michael,"But, because of my accidental experiment, these four humans got better after they died."
3,26,Michael,That's not supposed to be possible.
3,26,Michael,"Over and over, I watched as they became thoughtful and generous and caring."
3,26,Michael,And think about where they started.
3,26,Michael,"Uh, Jason."
3,26,Michael,"Growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do for fun after school every day?"
3,26,Jason Mendoza,Me and my friends whipped empty spray paint cans at flamingos.
3,26,Michael,And now he's so much better.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,I was already pretty good.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"When I was six, I hit one on the butt."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Let the immortal beings talk, darling."
3,26,Judge,So they got better in your little pretend world.
3,26,Judge,That doesn't prove anything about what they were like on Earth.
3,26,Michael,"No, see, I think it does prove something."
3,26,Michael,"If I'm right, the system by which we judge humans, the very method we use to deem them good or bad, is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable that hundreds of millions of people have been wrongly condemned to an eternity of torture."
3,26,Judge,Damn!
3,26,Judge,That was intense.
3,26,Judge,"Look at my arm, y'all."
3,26,Judge,"Look, I got goose bumps."
3,26,Michael,Huh.
3,26,Michael,Yeah.
3,26,Judge,Doesn't happen very often.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,So you saw your parents in the test?
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, and I immediately fell right back into my old pattern."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,Desperately trying to impress them and earn their admiration.
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Then I heard this little voice in my head saying, ""Tahani, don't do this."""
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,The little voice in your head sounds like the old lady from Downton Abbey?
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, sorry."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,Maggie Smith is my godmother.
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, I took a deep breath, told them I ate a Cheeto and walked away."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, you have made so much progress."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm proud of you, hot stuff."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Whatever progress I have made, it's because you and I have become mates."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's British for friends.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I know."
3,26,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"Man, think about everything that's happened to us."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"We died, Michael tortured us, we teamed up with him, we escaped."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"We went through the portal, the Judge ruled against us, then Michael showed up."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,This has been one of the craziest years of my life.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,One of?
3,26,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,I'm not sure what I would do if one more insane thing happened.
3,26,Janet,"Hi, Jason."
3,26,Janet,I love you.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, word?"
3,26,Janet,Word.
3,26,Janet,I've been avoiding telling you.
3,26,Janet,"My excuse was that I needed time to evaluate my complex feelings, but that was a rationalization."
3,26,Janet,"This might be the last time I ever get to talk to you, so there it is."
3,26,Janet,I love you.
3,26,Janet,And I hereby stop avoiding this topic and rationalizing it by saying the situation's complicated.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,Or that my brain is grinding like a fork in a garbage disposal.
3,26,Janet,"All right, whatever."
3,26,Janet,"You're not really a part of this, Chidi."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, guess what."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"I think I love you too, girl."
3,26,Janet,I'm not a girl.
3,26,Janet,I'm also not just a Janet anymore.
3,26,Janet,I don't know what I am.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's up?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hot diggity dog!
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now the thing I said right after we kissed will always be, ""Hot diggity dog."""
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whatever.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was an honest reaction.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I stand by it.
3,26,Judge,"Hi, guys, couple quick announcements."
3,26,Judge,Would anyone eat chips and guac if I put it out?
3,26,Judge,It's good.
3,26,Judge,It's homemade.
3,26,Judge,No takers?
3,26,Judge,A'ight.
3,26,Judge,"Second thing, we figured out a plan to save your souls."
3,26,Michael,"For the time being, the Judge is gonna put you in your own Medium Places, like Mindy St. Claire."
3,26,Michael,"And while you're there, I'll keep working every angle I can think of to get you guys into the Good Place for real."
3,26,Jason Mendoza,This is great.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,So we'd all be together?
3,26,Judge,"Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places."
3,26,Judge,"It has to be tailored to what's medium for the individual, so if you're all together, it ain't medium."
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,How much time will we be alone?
3,26,Michael,Hard to say.
3,26,Michael,"Uh, could be a month."
3,26,Judge,Could be a million years.
3,26,Michael,"So, between a month and a million years."
3,26,Judge,Yeah.
3,26,Judge,Give or take.
3,26,Michael,Somewhere in there.
3,26,Michael,"Come on, you guys."
3,26,Michael,"I know this isn't perfect, but I need more time to build my case."
3,26,Michael,And it's either this or back to the Bad Place.
3,26,Judge,Yeah.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll say it.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Both those options suck.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry if that's blunt, Your Honor, but it's true."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, Chidi laid one on me, so I'm kinda dizzy."
3,26,Michael,You two kissed?
3,26,Michael,Hot diggity dog.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I said.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, we've all gotten better."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why should we have to go live alone in a boring void because of a messed-up system?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,How is that justice?
3,26,Judge,"Okay, slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich."
3,26,Judge,"First of all, y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests I just gave you."
3,26,Judge,"Second, I still believe that the only reason that you improved in Michael's fake neighborhood is because you thought there was a reward at the end of the rainbow."
3,26,Judge,"You're supposed to do good things because you're good, not because you're seeking moral dessert."
3,26,Michael,And I still believe that they would've become good people if they'd just gotten a a push in the right direction.
3,26,Judge,"Oh, no."
3,26,Judge,No.
3,26,Judge,Nope.
3,26,Judge,Absolutely not.
3,26,Michael,It's a little crazy.
3,26,Judge,"""A little crazy""?"
3,26,Judge,It's looney tunes.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,What are they talking about?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,No idea.
3,26,Judge,It sets a very dangerous precedent.
3,26,Michael,It's only four people.
3,26,Michael,And it's clearly the best way to see if bad people can become good without knowing anything about what's waiting in the afterlife.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,Shotgun.
3,26,Jason Mendoza,"Whatever they're talking about, if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun."
3,26,Judge,It's never gonna work.
3,26,Michael,"If it doesn't, then they go right back to the Bad Place."
3,26,Michael,"No one gets hurt, except them."
3,26,Michael,Forever.
3,26,Michael,"And me, I assume, also forever."
3,26,Judge,"Mmm okay, let's do it."
3,26,Michael,Yes.
3,26,Judge,I don't know why.
3,26,Judge,I'm just feeling funky.
3,26,Judge,But there have to be strict rules.
3,26,Judge,"Otherwise, the results will be tainted."
3,26,Judge,And I reserve the right to change my mind at any point.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,About what?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Would someone who's not an eternal being please explain to me what the --
3,26,Joe,Why are you like this?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Excuse me?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Why am I like this?"""
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You don't know me, dude."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't know what I'm like.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look what you made me do, jagoff."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-oh.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy crap.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just almost died.
3,26,Madison,"God, Eleanor."
3,26,Madison,Take longer next time.
3,26,Brittany,"Oh, you look like crap."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was outside the supermarket arguing with that little environmental twerp.
3,26,Madison,"Ugh, I hate that guy."
3,26,Brittany,Really?
3,26,Brittany,That skinny little hippie body kinda turns me on.
3,26,Madison,Gross.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, listen."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I dropped the margarita mix.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And when I went to pick it up, a bunch of shopping carts came right at me and I was frozen."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then someone pushed me out of the way and the carts got demolished by a truck.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I could've died."
3,26,Madison,"Oh, my God."
3,26,Brittany,Whoa.
3,26,Brittany,That's crazy.
3,26,Brittany,So is the margarita mix gone?
3,26,Madison,I had a near-death experience recently.
3,26,Madison,You know that old warehouse that burned down last month and four people died?
3,26,Madison,That building is right by my old dentist.
3,26,Madison,"If I still went to that dentist and had an appointment that day, I would've been like right near there."
3,26,Brittany,"I was in Syracuse, New York, two weeks before 9/11."
3,26,Madison,No way!
3,26,Brittany,"Yeah, 14 days."
3,26,Madison,I can't believe we all almost died.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and I think I might be a monster."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm rude.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm selfish.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I cyber-bullied Ryan Lochte until he quit Instagram.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But something happened to me today, and from now on I'm gonna try to become a better, kinder, more generous person."
3,26,Brittany,Hey.
3,26,Brittany,Can I use your credit card?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, you can."
3,26,Brittany,Cool.
3,26,Brittany,It's for porn.
3,26,Brittany,I already used it.
3,26,Wallace,"Hey, you look happy."
3,26,Wallace,Did you get laid last night?
3,26,Wallace,I didn't.
3,26,Wallace,Tried.
3,26,Wallace,"Hard, with this chick that I met after I followed into a yoga class, but she wasn't into it."
3,26,Wallace,Maced me right in the eyes.
3,26,Wallace,Stung like hell.
3,26,Wallace,What was I saying?
3,26,Wallace,"Oh, yeah."
3,26,Wallace,Hey.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, dude."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What you're doing here, selling fake medicine to people, tricking them, is wrong."
3,26,Wallace,Yeah.
3,26,Wallace,And?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't be a part of it anymore.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm trying to become a better person.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,As long as I work here --
3,26,Wallace,"Yeah, sure, fine, whatever, you quit."
3,26,Wallace,Who cares?
3,26,Wallace,Gimme your company ID.
3,26,Wallace,Thank you.
3,26,Wallace,"And your parking pass and your panties, please."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude!
3,26,Wallace,What?
3,26,Wallace,"Come on, I had to try."
3,26,Wallace,"By the way, technically, that is not sexual harassment."
3,26,Wallace,She doesn't work here anymore.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're wearing a wire?
3,26,Wallace,Yeah.
3,26,Wallace,"Company's being investigated for fraud, so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down."
3,26,Wallace,Good timing on your part.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, get help."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm becoming a better person.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You should, too."
3,26,Betsy,"Hey, Eleanor, do you wanna come to Lauren's baby shower?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you want to chew on my ass-ortment of brownies that I will be bringing to Lauren's baby shower?
3,26,Betsy,Sure.
3,26,Joe,"Hi, there."
3,26,Joe,Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Remember me?
3,26,Joe,Ah!
3,26,Joe,Don't hurt me.
3,26,Joe,My bones are brittle.
3,26,Joe,I have a calcium deficiency.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I came to apologize.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There, I did it."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I apologized.
3,26,Joe,"No, you didn't."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, I did, ass face."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nope, you're right."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I apologize for being mean to you, like, a thousand times."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's really no excuse.
3,26,Joe,Thanks.
3,26,Joe,Apology accepted.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
3,26,Joe,"Uh, what's happening?"
3,26,Joe,I'm scared.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I'm on kinda like a self-improvement kick."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you think you could help me out?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Teach me to get all horny for the environment or whatever?
3,26,Joe,"Hey, everyone."
3,26,Joe,This is Eleanor.
3,26,Joe,She's joining the team.
3,26,Woman,Welcome!
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nice to meet you.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
3,26,Michael,"All right, Eleanor."
3,26,Madison,Mmm.
3,26,Madison,"Babes, get in on these nachos."
3,26,Madison,They're delish.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm actually trying to eat vegetarian.
3,26,Brittany,Ew!
3,26,Brittany,Why?
3,26,Madison,Is it because you feel bad for all the little animals with their cute little faces because people stuff them in a tiny cage so we can eat them?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's exactly why.
3,26,Madison,"Okay, guys, um, can I say something for a second?"
3,26,Madison,I love you.
3,26,Brittany,Aw
3,26,Madison,I do.
3,26,Madison,"I mean, I went through a really rough time last year with the whole Dress Bitch thing and people selling t-shirts with my face on them, but you two stuck by me."
3,26,Madison,"I love you, you dumb sluts."
3,26,Madison,Come on.
3,26,Brittany,Aw!
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, there's probably something we should tell you."
3,26,Brittany,Or not.
3,26,Brittany,We could also not.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's the right thing to do.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I tore your dress.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then I lied about it.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then Brittany and I were the ones who made and sold the T-shirts.
3,26,Brittany,But we did not keep the money.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, we did."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,We kept it all.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I'm really sorry.
3,26,Madison,Okay.
3,26,Madison,That took a lot of courage to admit.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
3,26,Madison,And I admire your honesty.
3,26,Madison,You stupid skank!
3,26,Madison,How could you do that to me?
3,26,Madison,I hate you!
3,26,Madison,You're both disgusting hogs and I want you to move out of my apartment forever!
3,26,Madison,"Literally, starting right now!"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm still glad we told the truth.
3,26,Brittany,Cool.
3,26,Waiter Stenn,"Okay, steamed vegetable medley and ice water."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I just get the check?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And can you throw these plants in the trash?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Damn it.
3,26,Brittany,They're suing you?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,This chick is claiming she has whiplash.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,She wasn't in the car when I hit it.
3,26,Brittany,This is on you.
3,26,Brittany,You should've pretended you didn't see it and walked away.
3,26,Brittany,Like everyone else does.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've hit your car six times and never said anything.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I'm trying to be good.
3,26,Brittany,How is that working out for you?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's open, dummy!"
3,26,Joe,"Eleanor, where have you been?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hey, man."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, it's been a crazy month, you know?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Moving was a hassle, and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit, and I ate vegetables for the first time, and I got diarrhea for a week."
3,26,Joe,"I know we don't pay a lot, but this is a job, and we need to know we can count on you."
3,26,Joe,We're meeting tonight to discuss strategy for the --
3,26,Brittany,"Dude, dude, dude oh, sorry to interrupt whatever boring crap this is, but you need to get dressed."
3,26,Brittany,"I got tickets to Taylor Splift, the Taylor Swift reggae cover band."
3,26,Brittany,They're terrible.
3,26,Brittany,It's going to be amazing.
3,26,Brittany,Hmm.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, that sounds like more fun."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'mma do that.
3,26,Joe,Eleanor!
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What, dude?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've been nothing but good for six months, and all I have to show for it is this crummy apartment, a lawsuit, a loose caboose and an overdrawn bank account."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Being good is for suckers.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you even get out of it?
3,26,Joe,A feeling of fulfillment in your soul.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gross.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's the grossest sentence I've ever heard.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I quit.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch."
3,26,Brittany,Whew!
3,26,Brittany,I still think he's hot.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I guess, in a sick Victorian boy kind of way."
3,26,Brittany,"Ooh, yeah."
3,26,Brittany,I want to feed him soup.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,So tell me about the new business.
3,26,Wallace,"We sell classes at a for-profit university, and the classes train people how to sell supplements."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,So it's a Ponzi scheme within a Ponzi scheme.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds dicey.
3,26,Wallace,"Oh, it's super dicey."
3,26,Wallace,"But I'm in witness protection, so, technically, I can't be convicted of any crime."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's definitely not true, but I also don't care."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Which one's my desk?
3,26,Michael,"You realize what the problem is, right?"
3,26,Janet,"Yes, but there's no way to help."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm only giving that guy three stars 'cause he didn't let me stick my head out the moon roof.
3,26,Brittany,Yeah!
3,26,Brittany,"Dude, my boyfriend just texted."
3,26,Brittany,"His wife's out of town, so I'm gonna head over there."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's lame.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Boo!
3,26,Brittany,Happy birthday!
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, bartender."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One alcoholic drink, please."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's my birthday if you wanna give it to me for free.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I always say that, but it actually is my birthday."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Last year, on my birthday I almost died, and then I did a bunch of stuff that was good, but weird, and then I stopped, and now I'm here."
3,26,Michael,Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
3,26,Michael,Want to talk about it?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And in the end, Anthony Anderson and Jerry O'Connell start a successful shampoo company, and you see the kangaroo jumping around Australia."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That is the plot to the movie Kangaroo Jack.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why did I tell you that?
3,26,Michael,It's unclear.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, the thing is the problem really with being a do-gooder?"
3,26,Michael,What's that?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one cares.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, some people care a little bit."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The twerpy little twerps from the environmental place, they care, but I was a good person for six months."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's like five years.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And it felt okay, but not as good as I thought it would."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,And what did I get for it?
3,26,Michael,"Ah, see?"
3,26,Michael,Now you're talking about moral dessert.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Exactly.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, I am?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,26,Michael,"Moral dessert is the concept that if you act with virtue, you deserve a reward."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,If I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow with a tiara or one of those diagonal award belts
3,26,Michael,Sash.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then why should I do good things?
3,26,Michael,"You know, I had a friend that said whenever she was doing something bad, she'd hear this little voice in her head."
3,26,Michael,"Distant little voice saying, ""Come on, now, you know this is wrong."""
3,26,Michael,"And then when she started doing good things, that voice went away."
3,26,Michael,It was a relief.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your friend sounds like she's one pickle short of a pickle party.
3,26,Michael,"She was a little rough around the edges, but she was also a really good person."
3,26,Michael,When she tried.
3,26,Michael,"See, I think that little voice was her conscience trying to guide her in the right direction."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I gotta go home.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I owe ya?
3,26,Michael,"The real question, Eleanor, is what do we owe to each other?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did I sell you a drink?
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I a bartender?
3,26,Michael,Drinks are on me.
3,26,Michael,Good luck.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ow!
3,26,Michael,Anybody notice I was gone?
3,26,Janet,Nope.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,What do we owe to each other?
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is the question I will try to answer over the next three hours."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, no, thanks."
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,We all have a voice in our head.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"That voice doesn't tell us what to do or not do, but it does warn us when we do things that don't feel good or right."
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,The difference between
3,26,Chidi Anagonye, reasonable.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,What does it mean to be a reasonable person?
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,I may have a different definition of reasonable
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"So why do it, then?"
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"Why choose to be good every day if there is no guaranteed reward we can count on, now or in the afterlife?"
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat them with dignity.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"Simply put, we are not in this alone."
3,26,Brittany,"Hi, dog bait."
3,26,Brittany,Didn't you get my message?
3,26,Brittany,Let's go.
3,26,Brittany,Time is booze.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no, thanks."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm going somewhere else.
3,26,Frim,"G'day, where you headed?"
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Saint John's University, please."
3,26,Frim,No worries.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,Office hours are on Tuesday.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I'm not a student."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you Chidi Ana Kendrick?
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,Anagonye.
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"And, yes."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"From the long, nerdy video about the little voice that tells you to be good?"
3,26,Chidi Anagonye,"From the Keswick Foundation lecture series on the practical applications of ethical theory, yes."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop."
3,26,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can we talk?
3,26,Michael,Okay.
3,26,Michael,Here we go.
3,27,Michael,"Hi, I'm Michael."
3,27,Michael,You must be the Doorman.
3,27,Michael,Ah.
3,27,Michael,This is wild.
3,27,Michael,I had no idea this was even here.
3,27,Michael,"So, I have this ruling from the Judge."
3,27,Michael,Heading on down to Earth to reverse the deaths of these four people.
3,27,Michael,"It's kinda tricky, you know?"
3,27,Michael,Starts up a new timeline.
3,27,Michael,So there might be some ripple effects.
3,27,Michael,But it's necessary for the experiment that we're doing there.
3,27,Michael,"So, how long does this trip take?"
3,27,Michael,Hope I don't get a middle seat.
3,27,The Doorman,"Wow, I haven't heard a joke in 8,000 years."
3,27,The Doorman,And I still haven't.
3,27,The Doorman,That's the door to Earth.
3,27,The Doorman,"Go through there, you'll be wherever you need to be."
3,27,The Doorman,"You won't have any other powers, though."
3,27,The Doorman,"You want to get around, you'll have to take a bus or something."
3,27,Michael,A bus?
3,27,Michael,"Oh, boy."
3,27,Michael,"Oh, man."
3,27,Michael,I'm gonna sit in a front-facing seat.
3,27,Michael,"No, no, maybe a sideways-facing seat."
3,27,Michael,I'm gonna get so motion sick.
3,27,Michael,"Oh, man!"
3,27,Michael,What do I do?
3,27,Michael,Just grab the key?
3,27,The Doorman,Whoa!
3,27,The Doorman,Whoa!
3,27,The Doorman,Whoa!
3,27,The Doorman,This key is made of the very first atoms that came into existence in the universe.
3,27,The Doorman,It is one of a kind and cannot be duplicated.
3,27,The Doorman,See?
3,27,The Doorman,"""Do not duplicate."""
3,27,The Doorman,Only I touch this key.
3,27,Michael,And what's the significance of the key chain?
3,27,The Doorman,Nothin'.
3,27,The Doorman,I just like frogs.
3,27,The Doorman,I'm a frog guy.
3,27,The Doorman,"When you need to get back here, make sure you're alone, press this button."
3,27,The Doorman,Any questions?
3,27,The Doorman,No?
3,27,The Doorman,Great.
3,27,The Doorman,Knock yourself out.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-oh.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, but this is an important moment in our --"
3,27,Michael,"On your right, pal!"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, jeez, watch it, man!"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Ahhh!
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come down!
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Come down, where you belong!"
3,27,Pillboi,Buongiorno!
3,27,Pillboi,Buongiorno.
3,27,Michael,"Oh, wow!"
3,27,Michael,I was just on Earth.
3,27,Michael,It was incredible.
3,27,Michael,"The the traffic, the pigeons, and I saw this place that was at once a Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell."
3,27,Michael,"I mean, oh, the mind reels."
3,27,Michael,A Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell!
3,27,Michael,Ah!
3,27,Michael,"Oh, Janet, it was everything I ever imagined."
3,27,Michael,I got to ride a bike.
3,27,Janet,Hmm.
3,27,Michael,I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.
3,27,Michael,"And then someone came up to me and said, ""Hot enough for ya?"""
3,27,Michael,And you know what I said?
3,27,Michael,"I said, ""Tell me about it."""
3,27,Janet,"Well, I am glad that you got to chew a gumball."
3,27,Michael,"Oh, damn."
3,27,Michael,I didn't even think to chew it.
3,27,Michael,Missed opportunity.
3,27,Michael,Shoot!
3,27,Janet,Did you also save their lives?
3,27,Michael,"Yes, of course."
3,27,Michael,Everyone is safe.
3,27,Michael,Including Jason.
3,27,Michael,"Now, just sit back and watch as they become better people."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Being good is for suckers.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you even get out of it?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I quit.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch."
3,27,Len Bee,"Morning, Chidi."
3,27,Len Bee,Blueberry muffin for ya?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I don't know."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I can't decide.
3,27,Len Bee,"You all right there, mate?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I've made my decision."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I want to start crying.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,27,Interviewer,"Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil."
3,27,Interviewer,I'm from International Sophisticate Magazine.
3,27,Interviewer,Mind if we ask you 582 questions?
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sounds delightful.
3,27,Interviewer,Where are we exactly?
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My pied-a-terre, just off the coast of Barcelona."
3,27,Interviewer,What's one thing people don't know about you?
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,That I was such a tomboy in high school.
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,See?
3,27,Interviewer,"Wow, looking good!"
3,27,Interviewer,"Okay, next question."
3,27,Interviewer,Who would you say is the most famous person in your phone?
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""It's not about who you know."
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Enlightenment comes from within."""
3,27,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Dalai Lama texted me that.
3,27,Jason Mendoza,"K, will you make me the happiest man in the world and agree to be my wife?"
3,27,Officer Ramirez,No.
3,27,Officer Ramirez,"Do you think my name is the letter ""K""?"
3,27,Jason Mendoza,Just say yes.
3,27,Jason Mendoza,"If we're married, legally, you can't arrest me."
3,27,Jason Mendoza,"Plus, bonus, you can have the stuff I stole."
3,27,Officer Ramirez,"Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery."
3,27,Jason Mendoza,Damn it!
3,27,Michael,Ugh.
3,27,Michael,"You realize what the problem is, right?"
3,27,Janet,"Yes, but there's no way to help."
3,27,Michael,Maybe there is.
3,27,Michael,"In the afterlife, they all got better because they helped each other."
3,27,Michael,And the key to that was Chidi and Eleanor's connection.
3,27,Michael,"If I get the two of them together, everything else will follow."
3,27,Janet,"Michael, no --"
3,27,Michael,I'm gonna meet Eleanor someplace and plant the idea in her mind that she needs to find Chidi.
3,27,Michael,And then maybe I'll visit Chidi and make sure that he helps her when she shows up.
3,27,Michael,I'm just gonna nudge the two of them together.
3,27,Michael,Just nudgy-nudge-nudge.
3,27,Janet,The Judge was pretty clear in her instructions.
3,27,Janet,"And the Judge is, you know, the Judge of, you know, the universe."
3,27,Michael,She'll never find out.
3,27,Michael,She spends all her time in her chambers binging TV shows.
3,27,Michael,She's watching all of NCIS right now.
3,27,Michael,"Hey, there."
3,27,Michael,Need to head on back to Earth.
3,27,The Doorman,Travel papers.
3,27,Michael,"You know, the Judge said to use the same ones."
3,27,Michael,"Cause I'm, uh, visiting the same people."
3,27,Michael,I almost forgot.
3,27,Michael,I brought you a nice hot cup of antimatter.
3,27,The Doorman,I usually only drink decaf antimatter.
3,27,Michael,Ah.
3,27,The Doorman,"Eh, I'll take it."
3,27,The Doorman,It's only 4:30.
3,27,The Doorman,My shift doesn't end till nine billion.
3,27,Michael,Ooh.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do I owe ya?
3,27,Michael,"The real question, Eleanor is what do we owe to each other?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"""What do we owe to each other?"""
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,And it is the question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you Chidi Ana Kendrick?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"""Anagonye"", and yes."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can we talk?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Sure.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, uh, where do I start?"
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm not, like, the best person in the world."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm a trash bag from Arizona, which is saying something."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Our biggest exports are racist sheriffs and HPV.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But about a year ago, something crazy happened."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I --
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, I've been flying for 40 hours."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This is Australia, right?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I grew up in Senegal so my native language is French."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,But I went to American school so I also speak English.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"And German, and Greek and Latin, just in case it ever comes back."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I once got 12 out of 12 on a BuzzFeed quiz called, ""Do you know all the slang words the Kardashians invented?"""
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Congratulations?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thank you.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna be honest.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did cheat.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,You were saying something crazy happened to you.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I almost died."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And it made me wanna become a better person, which I did, for a while, but then I fell back into my old, trash-bag ways."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yesterday, I saw your lecture and something just clicked."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,You flew all the way here from Arizona just to see me?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, don't flatter yourself, pal."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, that's exactly what I did."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I know that seems zonkatronic that's Khloe's word for crazy.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think I need it to be you.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you say?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Will you help me become a good person?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I'll start you off with some introductory philosophy books, and then we'll meet here once a week?"
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ideally, some of those books will have been made into a movie or maybe a funny GIF but anything is good with me, man."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I ask you something?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are you helping me?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm a teacher, that's my job."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but I'm not your student."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just some hot rando who walked in off the street.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's gotta be another reason.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, there is."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Um I also had a near-death experience.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't know for sure that I would have died, but it was pretty nuts."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm... I'm sorry, but this is an important moment in our --"
3,27,Michael,"On your right, pal!"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, jeez, watch it, man!"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Ahh!
3,27,Uzo,"Oh, my God."
3,27,Uzo,Are you okay?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,That that is right where I was standing.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I was frozen here, unable to make a simple decision."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,And I almost got crushed by an air conditioner.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,This is a sign.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I shouldn't be using air conditioners.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,The Freon is awful for the environment.
3,27,Uzo,That's the lesson you take from this?
3,27,Uzo,"Chidi, your brain is broken."
3,27,Uzo,You need to fix your brain.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"So, in a nutshell, I have a 3,600-page thesis that I am nowhere near finishing."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making and it is destroying my life.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Yeah, I sorta got that when you couldn't choose a chair to sit on."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I I didn't wanna offend you in case you had a favorite."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I know I just kinda no."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye, walked in here and you don't know me at all.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,But is there any way to tell if my indecision is due to a brain thing?
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Oh, yeah, sure."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Now what we do is, we make a lengthy incision from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck, and we peel your face back, right, and slice your skull open, and then I just randomly stab at your brain with an electrified needle."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"The fun part is, you're awake the whole time."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
3,27,Simone Garnett,I'm kidding.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Nah!
3,27,Simone Garnett,I'll just give you an MRI and look at the part of your brain that controls decision-making.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I want that."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I need to learn about my brain.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Please.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Well, so you just march into my office unannounced, tell me your brain is broken, and demand I drop everything and just put you in the university's $3 million MRI machine?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I'm sorry, I just --"
3,27,Simone Garnett,I freakin' love it.
3,27,Simone Garnett,You're so weird.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Let's go.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Right now?
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Oh, yeah, come on."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,27,Simone Garnett,This is your hippocampus.
3,27,Simone Garnett,It regulates memory.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Yours looks great.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Very strong.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Gorgeous hippocampus there.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"This is your ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the center of decision-making."
3,27,Simone Garnett,This is where the magic happens.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Do you see how it's all lit up?
3,27,Simone Garnett,"That's a flurry of activity that occurred when I asked you to choose between red and blue, and you almost passed out."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Is it too late to pick blue instead?
3,27,Simone Garnett,"It is, yeah."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Point is, at first glance, your brain is very healthy."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, there are actual answers here."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Data you can observe and learn from.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Yeah, man."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Science is all about getting answers.
3,27,Simone Garnett,You philosophers can spend your entire life mulling over a single question.
3,27,Simone Garnett,That's why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
3,27,Simone Garnett,No offense.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,None taken.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,We suck.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Yeah.
3,27,Len Bee,Chidi.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"One blueberry muffin, please."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Why choose to be good?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Every day?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Simply put, we are not in this alone."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
3,27,Henry,"Wow, Chidi."
3,27,Henry,You chose that muffin in less than a minute.
3,27,Henry,That beats your old record by 59 minutes.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Henry, I feel amazing."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I am 100 pages into my new thesis, and it is some of the best writing that I have ever done."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I haven't been this happy since oh, wow, I've never been happy."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Huh!
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Bad!
3,27,Henry,"I'm proud of you, mate."
3,27,Henry,Must be really nice to live that way.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's the beauty of it."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Anyone can live this way.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Just decide to be more decisive.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, what's something that you always wanted to do?"
3,27,Henry,"I mean, I have been putting off getting in shape."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Then make the decision to wake up tomorrow morning and get in shape.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,It is that easy.
3,27,Henry,Okay.
3,27,Henry,Maybe I will.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,What have you got to lose?
3,27,Henry,Nothing!
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Henry, what happened to you?"
3,27,Henry,"Well, I was using the leg press at the gym, and you know how your legs bend a certain way?"
3,27,Henry,My legs bend the other way now.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
3,27,Henry,All the tendons in my legs snapped like violin strings.
3,27,Henry,"And then my foot flew forwards, and I kicked myself in the face, which gave me a concussion."
3,27,Henry,"But on the bright side, I lost control of my bladder, someone got it on video, and now ""leg-press whizzer"" has 62,000 views on YouTube."
3,27,Henry,I'm famous.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,This is all my fault.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I did this to you.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Uh-uh.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Muffins.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I brought blueberry muffins.
3,27,Nurse Pat,"Oh, no, you shouldn't eat blueberries anymore."
3,27,Nurse Pat,I read an article.
3,27,Nurse Pat,The migrant workers who pick them are horribly mistreated.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Gah!
3,27,Len Bee,"Morning, Chidi."
3,27,Len Bee,Blueberry muffin for ya?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I don't know."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I can't decide.
3,27,Len Bee,"You all right there, mate?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I've made my decision."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I want to start crying.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Excuse me, what is the maximum number of books that I can check out?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Is it 12,000?"
3,27,Michael,Got a wild weekend planned?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I need to find a new topic for my thesis, and I had this thing happen that made me more decisive, and a few months ago, my friend broke both his legs."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,It's my fault.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,And blueberries.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,And I need help.
3,27,Michael,Whoo!
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe that help will come from Tay Zonday's autobiography Chocolate Book!
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, who's to say?"
3,27,Michael,"Mate, I've worked in this library a long time, and I've seen a lot of academic types with that same helpless look on their faces."
3,27,Michael,They all made it through okay.
3,27,Michael,Once they learned the secret.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,What's the secret?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,There's a secret?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Is the secret more books?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,How many more books do I need?
3,27,Michael,"It's not about books, mate."
3,27,Michael,It's about perspective.
3,27,Michael,"Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless, the secret is to help someone else, get out of your own head."
3,27,Michael,Trust me.
3,27,Michael,Next time someone asks for help say yes.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"A few hours later, you walked in and asked for help."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, I don't know if this is going to solve all of my problems, but it's worth a try."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Right?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,I didn't say he was sexy.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I know, but whenever anyone tells me a story about their life, I always imagine all the people as being super hot."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Otherwise, I quickly lose interest."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you not do that?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can do it for free.
3,27,Michael,"I gotta say, I enjoyed playing the role of mysterious librarian, and I really nailed the Australian accent."
3,27,Janet,Uh-huh.
3,27,Janet,Flawless.
3,27,Michael,Thank you.
3,27,Michael,"But the point is, Eleanor and Chidi are together, and now we can relax."
3,27,Michael,Everything is finally on track.
3,27,Shawn,Status report.
3,27,Val,"They're plugging away, but we still can't hack into the Judge's system."
3,27,Shawn,Damn it!
3,27,Shawn,Those four humans have been on Earth for over a year.
3,27,Shawn,I need to know if they're getting better.
3,27,Glenn,Can I just ask?
3,27,Glenn,We torture 30 billion humans.
3,27,Glenn,Why do you care so much about these four?
3,27,Glenn,Never mind.
3,27,Glenn,Forget I asked.
3,27,Todd Hemple,"Serves him right for questioning you, boss."
3,27,Todd Hemple,I think you're doing a great job.
3,27,Shawn,"Thank you, Todd."
3,27,Todd Hemple,"No, no, no, no --"
3,27,Val,Why did you do that?
3,27,Shawn,I'm a demon.
3,27,Shawn,It's fun.
3,27,Shawn,No one leaves this room until we've accessed the Judge's system.
3,27,Val,Would music help?
3,27,Val,Should I play some music?
3,27,Shawn,Good idea.
3,27,Shawn,Choose something deeply terrible to inspire us.
3,27,Shawn,"Oh, yeah."
3,27,Shawn,That's the stuff.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"So, for Aristotle, virtue is practical."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Goodness isn't something that a person just inherently has.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,It's something that she achieves through her actions.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Questions?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, yeah, a few."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I wrote down, ""What? Huh?"""
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then this doodle of a burrito because when I first read Aristotle, I thought it was pronounced like ""Chipotle""."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wait a minute.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Is it ""chip-a-tottle""."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"These are all great questions, but I have to meet my thesis advisor across campus."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I'm headed that way, too."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll walk with you.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, so I've been trying to figure out how to pay you back for helping me."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I told you, you don't owe me anything."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At home, when I want to get something nice for one of my friends, it usually comes in the form of something edible."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,You get what I'm saying?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,An edible thing?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Please don't buy me drugs.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, copy that."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I had no choice.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was in his driveway taking pictures when he walked out, so I said, ""Hey, Mr. Crowe, I'm from the gas company."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I loved you in Gladiator."""
3,27,Simone Garnett,Chidi!
3,27,Simone Garnett,Hey!
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Hey!
3,27,Simone Garnett,I got a question.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Is it, ""What's my thesis topic?"""
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Because I still don't know.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"No, it's not that."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I'm sorry, you guys haven't met yet."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Simone, this is Eleanor."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,The famous Simone.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nice to meet you.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"You, too."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"So, I've got to do some MRI scans as a control for an experiment, and since you loved it so much last time, I was wondering if you could just pop back in there, help me out?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, absolutely."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Cool.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Okay, well, just come by my lab at 6:00, and then afterwards, I can buy you dinner as a thank you."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Oh.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Okay.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Well, I'll see you later."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Nice to meet you.
3,27,Simone Garnett,Yeah.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You, too."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh you and Simone have some real professor-dork vibes flowing.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're both teachers who are hot for teacher.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,How have you not asked her out yet?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you scared?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,No.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"It's not impressive to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm scared of everything, and I can't just do things like that."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Just drop it, okay?"
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well --
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Just promise me you'll drop it.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promise.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you're into Chidi, right?"
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Forgive my bluntness, but I'm usually right about these things."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Well, yeah, but I made it pretty clear a bunch of times, and he's never responded, so I just assumed he wasn't interested."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I'm all set."
3,27,Simone Garnett,"I'm just gonna ask you some basic questions, Chidi."
3,27,Simone Garnett,What is one plus one?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Two.
3,27,Simone Garnett,What color is the sky?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Blue.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,What color are Simone's eyes?
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Brown.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you could take Simone anywhere on a date, where would you take her?"
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, is this part of the experiment?"
3,27,Simone Garnett,"It is now, yes."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Please answer the question.
3,27,Simone Garnett,And keep in mind we can see your brain.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Next question.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are into Simone.
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,That's not a question.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you agree it's a fact."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Next question's for Simone.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi for waiting so long to ask you out?"
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Yes, I am."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, same question for you."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you annoyed at yourself for waiting so long to ask out Simone?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I'm annoyed with you and I've only known you three weeks."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I am obviously very annoyed with myself."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Can I get out now?
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you can't."
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,It'll ruin the science.
3,27,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There's only one question left, and you gotta ask it, bud."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,"Simone, would you like to have dinner with me?"
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Wow, that is highly inappropriate."
3,27,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
3,27,Simone Garnett,I'm just kidding.
3,27,Simone Garnett,"Yes, I would."
3,27,Simone Garnett,Thank you for asking.
3,27,Janet,"Oh, cute."
3,27,Michael,This is a disaster.
3,27,Janet,"Michael, relax."
3,27,Michael,How are the two of them gonna bond?
3,27,Janet,"There were plenty of reboots where Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soulmates, and he still always helped her."
3,27,Janet,Simone and Chidi are good together.
3,27,Janet,I've been running simulations on what their kids will be like.
3,27,Janet,"One of them is hot enough to be on The Bachelor, and smart enough to never go on The Bachelor."
3,27,Michael,This is not just about Chidi.
3,27,Michael,I have left too much to chance.
3,27,Michael,"Until our group is back together again, this whole thing is hanging by a thread."
3,27,Michael,I'm going back down.
3,27,Janet,You're pressing your luck.
3,27,Janet,"If you keep disobeying Mommy, something bad is going to happen."
3,27,Michael,What?
3,27,Janet,"I don't have a mom, so I've been experimenting with thinking of the Judge as my mom."
3,27,Janet,It's weird.
3,27,Janet,Forget it.
3,27,Michael,Okay.
3,27,Janet,How are you even gonna get Jason and Tahani to Australia?
3,27,Michael,"I have no idea, but I have to try."
3,27,Janet,"Well, good luck, Dad."
3,27,Janet,Nope.
3,27,Janet,Also weird.
3,27,Janet,Just go.
3,27,Michael,"Hey, bud."
3,27,Michael,Brought you some decaf hazelnut antimatter.
3,27,Michael,"Just a little treat for my old pal, the Doorman."
3,27,Michael,"Heading back down, by the way."
3,27,The Doorman,You sure the Judge is okay with you going back to Earth so many times?
3,27,Michael,"Oh, yeah, yeah, all good."
3,27,Michael,See?
3,27,Michael,Still got the papers.
3,27,Michael,Shouldn't be long.
3,27,Shawn,"How we doing, Steve?"
3,27,Steve,I'm trying.
3,27,Steve,I'm getting close.
3,27,Shawn,Good.
3,27,Shawn,No pressure.
3,27,Steve,Ah-ha.
3,27,Steve,"Someone just went down to Earth, and that gave me a backdoor to the Judge's system."
3,27,Steve,Now we can see everything that's happening with all four humans.
3,27,Shawn,"Excellent work, Steve."
3,27,Val,Uh-oh.
3,27,Val,Looks like someone's been cocooning again.
3,27,Val,"You know, it would be a real help if you let me know the next time you're about to --"
3,27,Shawn,"Well, well, well."
3,27,Shawn,Looks like Michael's been caught with his hand in the human jar.
3,27,Glenn,"Good one, boss!"
3,27,Shawn,"Shut up, Glenn!"
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Morning, teach!"
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ready to discuss philosophy.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Obviously, I'm kidding."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,How was your date with Simone?
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Spill it, sweetheart."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,We had a great time.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Thank you, again, for bullying me into asking her out."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I owed it to you."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And bonus, I realized I was practicing virtue ethics by helping the two of you bone down."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, not appropriate."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Also not a great understanding of virtue ethics.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can agree to disagree.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"But, if you must know, it was very chaste."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,We didn't even kiss.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because you chickened out?
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"I did, yeah."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"I totally chickened out, and I am so mad at myself."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, hey, maybe it wasn't the right moment."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Knowing the two of you nerds, your first kiss is gonna be while reading Plato in an MRI machine."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Hang on.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Come with me.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Simone, what's the one thing Eleanor and I have in common?"
3,28,Simone Garnett,You both have a complete disregard for my office hours.
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Sorry, Reginald."
3,28,Reginald,"Ah, no worries."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, Eleanor is an Arizona trash bag"
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yep.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye," her words, not mine"
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Totally.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye, who once told me that her greatest accomplishment was breaking into Charles Barkley's house.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,He was on the road.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I snuck in through the doggie door, tried on all his giant shoes."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,One of my top five Christmases.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Listen, the point is, Eleanor and I have nothing in common, except that we both almost died and it made us wanna be better people."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,This is my thesis idea.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,I will explore the effect of near-death experiences on ethical decision-making.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"I will get a group of people together who've had near-death experiences, ask them ethical questions, and see if there's any commonalities!"
3,28,Simone Garnett,That's great.
3,28,Simone Garnett,Why are you yelling it at me?
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Because I need your help.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,You and your magic brain-scan machine!
3,28,Simone Garnett,Oh!
3,28,Simone Garnett,Of course!
3,28,Simone Garnett,A joint study with the neuroscience department!
3,28,Simone Garnett,We can use MRI mapping to see if a near-death experience alters brain function.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"There's something there, right?"
3,28,Simone Garnett,Definitely.
3,28,Simone Garnett,I love this.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Also, I wanted to kiss you last night, but I chickened out, so I'm gonna kiss you now."
3,28,Simone Garnett,Good.
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Yes, I want that, please."
3,28,Simone Garnett,Oh.
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Sorry, Reginald."
3,28,Simone Garnett,What were you saying?
3,28,Reginald,"Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow 'cause my grandma died?"
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oof!
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Real mood-ruiner.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Read the room, dude."
3,28,Michael,Bingo.
3,28,Michael,Okay.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Good, you're here."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, meet the newest member of our ethical neuroscientific study, Tahani Al-Jamil."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Eleanor."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Delighted to meet you.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Al-Jamil""."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, you're Kamilah's sister."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I am, yes."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If you want an autograph or something, I could probably arrange it."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Eh.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was never really that into her.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,No offense.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I assure you, there is none taken."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, how did you come to join our team?"
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,It began about a year ago.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come down!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Come down, where you belong!"
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
3,28,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"Well done, Tahani."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who saved me?
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did anyone see who just saved my life?
3,28,Woman 1,It was Kamilah.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, it was a man, I think."
3,28,Woman 2,It was Kamilah!
3,28,Man 1,It was Kamilah!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,It wasn't Kamilah!
3,28,Man 2,It was Kamilah!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,It was someone over there.
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Crowd,Kamilah!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I had almost died.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In that very moment, I decided to change my life."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"First, I cleansed myself of all the worldly possessions that had been weighing me down like anchors."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The dresses, the jewels, I gave them all to Good Will."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's what I call Prince William.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Since he'd married a commoner, I assumed he'd know some needy people they could go to."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Then, I deleted all my celebrity contacts from my mobile."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Goodbye, Bono."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Goodbye, The Edge."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Goodbye, The Edge's real phone number that even Bono doesn't have."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And most importantly, I put physical distance between me and my old life."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Book me a flight to Tibet.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to live in a Buddhist monastery.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I need to get out of the spotlight.
3,28,Phaedra,Copy that.
3,28,Phaedra,I'll see what jets are available.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm flying commercial.
3,28,Phaedra,Okay.
3,28,Phaedra,"First class, I assume?"
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm a woman of the people now.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Comfort plus.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And there, in that humble monastery, thousands of miles from the meaningless concerns of high society, I embarked upon a quest for enlightenment."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I learned to embrace a life of simplicity.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I meditated.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I worked.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I gave back to Mother Earth.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I slept.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,My soul had never felt so nourished.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Until one day, my former life came knocking at the open space where a door would have been, if we were given any privacy."
3,28,Colby,Yo!
3,28,Colby,Is that Tahani Al-Jamil?
3,28,Colby,"Man, it totes is you!"
3,28,Colby,What up?
3,28,Colby,I'm Colby.
3,28,Colby,Squalor News.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,What are you doing in this monastery?
3,28,Colby,"We're doing a new show about poverty, drug lords, gun running, weird-ass restaurants, skateboarding and oh, and also genocide."
3,28,Colby,It's called Society is Effed!
3,28,Colby,"What are you doing here, though?"
3,28,Colby,Is this where you came after your sister saved your life?
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am living here as a way to shed my desire for attention.
3,28,Colby,Tight!
3,28,Colby,That's what's up.
3,28,Colby,"You gotta shed that, right?"
3,28,Colby,"But listen, if you ever want us to do a monster profile on you and your monk junk, we would be honored AF."
3,28,Colby,I think people would be supes interested in what you're doing here.
3,28,Colby,For real.
3,28,Colby,"Look, here's my card."
3,28,Colby,Think about it.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Of course, I never called him to do that profile, because I didn't pursue a life of tranquility to get in front of a camera."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did it to get out of the spotlight.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And that's what my book is about, shedding your need for validation from others!"
3,28,Phaedra,Publisher says you'll hit two million copies sold by next week.
3,28,Phaedra,Your 582 Questions With video was nominated for a BAFTA.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's fun.
3,28,Phaedra,"Also, they want you for Oprah."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oprah's off the air.
3,28,Phaedra,"No, they want you to take over for Oprah."
3,28,Phaedra,"Also, this investigator wants to meet you."
3,28,Phaedra,I checked him out.
3,28,Phaedra,He's legit.
3,28,Michael,Tahani.
3,28,Michael,Gordon Indigo.
3,28,Michael,"I just have to say, you are so inspiring."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Aw.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Namaste.
3,28,Michael,"I mean, you really have all these idiots fooled."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excuse me?
3,28,Michael,"Listen, I'm sure you're already rolling in dough from this incredible scam, but have you thought about merch?"
3,28,Michael,Because we could partner here.
3,28,Michael,I made a fortune selling Nirvana orbs.
3,28,Michael,Which is to say driving range golf balls that I painted silver.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's awful.
3,28,Michael,"No, it's healing."
3,28,Michael,Wink.
3,28,Michael,"You should be selling whatever crap you can think of, 'cause these people will buy it."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is quite enough!
3,28,Michael,Hmm?
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,And how dare you insinuate that I'm not authentic.
3,28,Phaedra,I've finished signing your headshots.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, not now."
3,28,Michael,"Miss Al-Jamil, it's okay."
3,28,Michael,You and I are the same.
3,28,Michael,I love what you're doing here.
3,28,Michael,"You get to be rich and famous, and not have to do any of the work of helping people."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,But I am helping people.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,You need to go.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Right now!
3,28,Michael,Suit yourself.
3,28,Michael,"Look, if you change your mind, I'm online."
3,28,Michael,"Just Google ""crystals that prevent erectile dysfunction""."
3,28,Phaedra,"I'm sorry, but Miss Al-Jamil doesn't have time to participate in an ethical study at some random university."
3,28,Phaedra,"If you want to meet her, you can sign up for the ""Get Out of the Spotlight"" cruise, with special guests Deepak Chopra and Will.i.am."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello?
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is Tahani Al-Jamil.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, hi, I didn't think I'd actually get you."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"My name is Chidi Anagonye, and I'm doing an academic study on near-death experiences and ethical decision-making."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,I read an article about you --
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Will it help people?
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's all I want to know.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Will this help people?
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I I think so."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,I mean that's the goal.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,Send me the info.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll be there tomorrow morning.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But how had you learned about me, I wonder?"
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,A professor I'd never heard of named Charles Brainman sent me an article about you.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Said you'd be perfect for our study.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, welcome to Australia."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, if you need a place to crash while you get settled, my motel has a pullout sofa."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Although, as I say that, and I look at you and your whole thing, I realize that's absurd, and you should probably just get your own place."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, I I think that's, uh best."
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,But but thank you!
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
3,28,Michael,Three down one to go.
3,28,Michael,"Sup, bud?"
3,28,Michael,I've been looking for you.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, sorry, are these your rocks?"
3,28,Michael,Nah.
3,28,Michael,"Look, my name is Zack Pizazz, international talent scout."
3,28,Michael,"I've been tracking your dance troupe, man."
3,28,Michael,I think you really got the goods.
3,28,Michael,I want you to come on down to Australia and start a new crew.
3,28,Michael,All right?
3,28,Michael,I'll pay for everything.
3,28,Michael,"May have a few other obligations, but, basically --"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I'm done with dancing.
3,28,Michael,But whoa-oh-oh.
3,28,Michael,"You you heard what my name was, right?"
3,28,Michael,Zack Pizazz?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,My life is just kinda messed up right now.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I had a really tough year.
3,28,Michael,I'm sorry.
3,28,Michael,Want to talk about it?
3,28,Michael,I'm a pretty good listener.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Well, my year started about a year ago"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Pillboi?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I can't breathe and I'm freaking out and I'm almost out of Whip-Its!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Pillboi!
3,28,Pillboi,Buongiorno!
3,28,Pillboi,Buongiorno.
3,28,Pillboi,"Yo, what happened?"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I couldn't breathe!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,The snorkel must have been broken.
3,28,Pillboi,"Yo, that sucks."
3,28,Pillboi,You ready to get back in there?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Nah, man."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,We're not doing this no more.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I almost died trying to rob a Mexican restaurant.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I have to change my life.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I know what I'm gonna do.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna win this dance competition!
3,28,Michael,"So, you didn't see any other posters there?"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,No.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Don't think so.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Why?
3,28,Michael,Doesn't matter.
3,28,Michael,Continue.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Homies, I almost died yesterday, but we've been given a second chance."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Three months from today, on this very stage, in the Carmen Electra Auditorium, right here at the Smith & Wesson Performing Arts Center and ATV Repair Shop, we are going to win this dance competition."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"""How"", you ask?"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,By working!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"We are going to eat, breathe and vape dance."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I want you thinking about dance 24/7.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"That means every day, you think 20 thoughts about dance for seven minutes, and if you can't promise me that you'll give this dance crew everything that you've got, then you can walk out that door right now."
3,28,Donkey Doug,Yeah.
3,28,Donkey Doug,"Okay, I'm out."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,What?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Come on, Donkey Doug, after all we've been through?"
3,28,Donkey Doug,"Listen, you know you're my boy, but this sounds like a lot of work."
3,28,Donkey Doug,Good luck.
3,28,Donkey Doug,Pew-pew.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Pew-pew.
3,28,Donkey Doug,"Donkey Doug, out!"
3,28,Li'l Peanut,Damn.
3,28,Li'l Peanut,"That's a tough blow, but now that those guys are no longer members of our crew, we can legally rob their houses!"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"No, Li'l Peanut, we're gonna do this the right way."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,No more crime.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"And if you don't like that, you can walk out that door right now."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,What?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Come on!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"We still got, like, 35 people, so let's get to work."
3,28,Gatorbait,Quick announcement.
3,28,Gatorbait,"Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel with golden pythons painted on both sides, license plate ""GOT MILF"", please see an usher?"
3,28,Gatorbait,Your car has exploded.
3,28,Gatorbait,"All right, y'all ready for the next act?"
3,28,Gatorbait,Please give it up right now for Dance Dance Resolution!
3,28,Gatorbait,"In the six-year history of this competition, no crew has ever received a perfect score from our judges."
3,28,Gatorbait,That changed tonight.
3,28,Gatorbait,"But before we get to that, Dance Dance Resolution has been disqualified."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,What?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,No!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Why?
3,28,Gatorbait,Because you have 40 people on stage.
3,28,Gatorbait,The limit is eight.
3,28,Gatorbait,"Also, one of your members tried to carjack me on my way in here."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"No, that was Donkey Doug, and he's not a part of our crew anymore."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,We win!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,We win!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,We win!
3,28,All,We win!
3,28,All,We win!
3,28,All,We win!
3,28,Gatorbait,No.
3,28,Gatorbait,"Again, you are disqualified."
3,28,Woman 1,And the winner is Panther Blood!
3,28,Man,And the winner is Suck Monsters.
3,28,Woman 2,And the winner is nobody.
3,28,Woman 2,All teams are disqualified due to violence.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, well, we're out of rent money."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"So, remember that thing I said about ""no more crime""?"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,That's over now.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Go do crime.
3,28,Officer Ramirez,"Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Damn it.
3,28,Cop Over Radio,That was easy.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Look, please let me go."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I only did it to pay rent for my dance crew's rehearsal space.
3,28,Officer Ramirez,"Oh, then, you're in luck."
3,28,Officer Ramirez,We only arrest people for robbery if they don't have a reason.
3,28,Pillboi,Sorry it took me so long to bail you out.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Nah, it was my fault."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I shouldn't have used my one phone call to prank the police department.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Man, a year ago, I almost died, and I'm exactly the same as I was before."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,A failure.
3,28,Pillboi,You're not a failure.
3,28,Pillboi,You're a dreamer.
3,28,Pillboi,"Look, I like my job at the old folks home."
3,28,Pillboi,"Those old biddies are sweet, and sometimes they give me what they think are candy, but are really loose Vicodin."
3,28,Pillboi,"But when I'm with you, I feel like the sky's the limit."
3,28,Pillboi,I feel like someday I'll be able to buy my own Vicodin and it'll never turn out to actually be laxatives.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Thanks, dog, but if my life ended today, what would my legacy be?"
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike through an entire Waffle House."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,And I was once interviewed on the news for finding a foot on the beach.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"But, yo, other than that, I have no truly great accomplishments."
3,28,Pillboi,"Bro, I'm only saying this because I love you."
3,28,Pillboi,Do you want a Vicodin right now?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"So I walked out of that bar, came down to this wharf, threw a rock at a snake, met a guy named Zack Pizazz, talked to him about my crazy year that I've had, which started when I was locked in a safe."
3,28,Michael,"No, that was me."
3,28,Michael,I'm Zack Pizazz.
3,28,Michael,We're caught up now.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"A year ago, if you had asked me to run a dance crew in Atlantis"
3,28,Michael,Australia.
3,28,Jason Mendoza, I would have said yes for sure.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"But now, and I know this sounds crazy, but I'm starting to think there might be more to life than amateur street-dancing competitions."
3,28,Michael,"It's funny, but I know exactly what you mean."
3,28,Michael,"My goal in life used to be completely different, too."
3,28,Michael,I used to rep this crew called The Demons.
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Whoa!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,I remember you guys!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Didn't you all die when someone brought a hammerhead shark into your hot tub?
3,28,Michael,Different Demons.
3,28,Michael,"The point is, I had to leave my old crew behind, you know?"
3,28,Michael,But I met new friends who helped me become a better person.
3,28,Michael,"Look, I know this group of people who are also searching for meaning."
3,28,Michael,They might be able to help you find what you're looking for.
3,28,Michael,What do you think?
3,28,Michael,You wanna meet 'em?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, that sounds great."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Do we have to leave right now?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,My friend gave me a pill that I realized one second ago was definitely a laxative.
3,28,Michael,"No, go, go!"
3,28,Michael,"Well, that is the last time I'll need to head back down there."
3,28,Michael,"So to thank you for your help, I brought you back something from Earth."
3,28,Michael,A little token of my appreciation.
3,28,Michael,It keeps your antimatter warmer for longer.
3,28,The Doorman,It's a frog.
3,28,Michael,Yeah.
3,28,The Doorman,There's a frog on it.
3,28,Michael,Yeah.
3,28,The Doorman,"Right there, it's a frog!"
3,28,The Doorman,"Man, it's green."
3,28,The Doorman,It's classic.
3,28,The Doorman,"This guy's a jumper, you can tell."
3,28,The Doorman,Thank you!
3,28,Michael,You're welcome.
3,28,Michael,"Wow, that really went over big."
3,28,Janet,How's Jason?
3,28,Janet,Is he still cute?
3,28,Michael,He looks about the same.
3,28,Janet,That sounds cute!
3,28,Judge,"Hey, guys."
3,28,Michael,Oh.
3,28,Michael,"Hey, Judge."
3,28,Janet,Hey!
3,28,Judge,Long time no see.
3,28,Michael,Yeah.
3,28,Judge,How's it going?
3,28,Janet,So good.
3,28,Janet,"I mean, everything is going according to plan, and nothing is going differently from the plan."
3,28,Michael,"Yes, that's a very not-weird way to put it."
3,28,Judge,"Well, I'm just stretching my legs."
3,28,Judge,Just binged 300 episodes of NCIS.
3,28,Michael,Oof!
3,28,Judge,"You know, I'm not a human woman, but that Mark Harmon can get it."
3,28,Janet,Oh.
3,28,Judge,You know what I'm saying?
3,28,Judge,"Speaking of human cutie pies, how's that Chidi doing?"
3,28,Michael,"Oh, sorry, Judge, let me just"
3,28,Janet,"Oh, hey!"
3,28,Janet,You know what you would love if you like Mark Harmon?
3,28,Judge,Uh-huh?
3,28,Janet,Stealing Home.
3,28,Janet,"He is very sexy in Stealing Home, according to the private thoughts of more than seven million Caucasian women."
3,28,Judge,Oh.
3,28,Judge,Hot tip.
3,28,Judge,"Thanks, y'all."
3,28,Judge,You guys wanna come with?
3,28,Janet,Ooh.
3,28,Michael,Ooh.
3,28,Judge,We can watch together.
3,28,Judge,I can whip up some nachos.
3,28,Janet,"I am incapable of eating, so"
3,28,Judge,"Suit yourselves, party poopers!"
3,28,Janet,Ah.
3,28,Michael,Ah.
3,28,Michael,Party poopers!
3,28,Judge,I guess it'll just be me and Mark then.
3,28,Michael,"Naughty, naughty!"
3,28,Janet,"Oh, boy!"
3,28,Janet,"Michael, we almost just got busted."
3,28,Michael,"Yeah, but we didn't."
3,28,Michael,"And more importantly, Jason just arrived in Australia."
3,28,Michael,The four of them are finally together.
3,28,Michael,"Oh, we did it, Janet!"
3,28,Michael,We got away with it.
3,28,Janet,Hmm.
3,28,Simone Garnett,"So, this is our MRI machine."
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Ooh, don't touch that."
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Um, each of you will get a chance in here eventually."
3,28,Simone Garnett,"Hopefully, none of you is claustrophobic."
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Claustrophobic?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Who would ever be scared of Santa Claus?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Oh!
3,28,Jason Mendoza,The Jewish!
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,You from Florida?
3,28,Jason Mendoza,Jacksonville.
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,That should be fine for me.
3,28,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's roughly the same size as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic anti-aging chamber, and I've never had a problem in there."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll be okay, too."
3,28,Eleanor Shellstrop,It kinda reminds me of the home-tanning booth I lost my virginity in.
3,28,Simone Garnett,Wow.
3,28,Simone Garnett,I cannot wait to take a look at these three brains.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Forgot to mention.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,There's one more person who will be joining us.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Seems like a really interesting guy.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"He was almost run over by a train a few months ago, heard about the study, emailed me last night."
3,28,Michael,This doesn't make any sense.
3,28,Michael,They're all there.
3,28,Michael,What's going on?
3,28,Michael,"Oh, no."
3,28,Janet,What is it?
3,28,Michael,"Something bad, Janet."
3,28,Michael,Something very dark and evil.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, yes."
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,Come on in.
3,28,Chidi Anagonye,"Everyone, this is Trevor."
3,28,Trevor,"Hey, guys!"
3,28,Trevor,It is so great to meet you.
3,29,Janet,"Michael, a demon has infiltrated the group."
3,29,Michael,Not just any demon.
3,29,Michael,"Trevor is a diabolical, sadistic agent of evil."
3,29,Michael,He might just be the single most dangerous creature in the universe.
3,29,Trevor,Who wants lemon bars?
3,29,Trevor,It's my nana's recipe and they are just sinful.
3,29,Trevor,"Love 'em on my lips, but hate 'em on my hips, if you know what I mean."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, new guy."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Comin' in strong with free dessert.
3,29,Trevor,"You must be Eleanor, the reason this is all happening."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's so nice to hear someone say, ""Eleanor, you're the reason this is all happening"", who isn't a judge in small claims court."
3,29,Trevor,"Thank you for this, Eleanor."
3,29,Trevor,It's a wonderful thing you've done.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Happy to help you out, buddy."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're doing a long hug.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you crying?
3,29,Trevor,I'm sorry.
3,29,Trevor,"I'm just so happy to be here, if that makes sense."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, the five of us narrowly avoided death."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,The operating theory of this experiment is that a second
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I give them ethics problems and we scan their brains, and we get a sense of their baseline moral instincts."
3,29,Simone Garnett,Right.
3,29,Simone Garnett,"Then, I'll show them pictures that trigger memories of their near-death experiences."
3,29,Simone Garnett,We'll scan again and see if we get a different result.
3,29,Simone Garnett,"For example, I'll show Jason pictures of a safe, a snorkel and whip-it canisters."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Got it.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Also, what a grim death that would've been."
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Darling, do you remember all the rules about what can and cannot be worn inside an MRI?"
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"More specifically, what if one's brassiere is very thin, but also very pure gold?"
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know, but I'm in a similar situash because the sports bra I'm wearing is kind of rust-colored underneath the armpits, so I guess we'll roll the dice together."
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, Eleanor, do I have the right phone number for you?"
3,29,Trevor,You haven't responded to any of the dank memes I've sent.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh yeah, I 'cause I was laughing too hard to reply."
3,29,Trevor,"Okay, what's your fave?"
3,29,Trevor,"Cause mine's ""Damn, Daniel --"""
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"""Back at it again with the white Vans!"""
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Should we get started, maybe?"
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, Mrs. Teacher?"
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"For my turn, is there any way to get, like, extra radiation?"
3,29,Simone Garnett,"There is no radiation in an MRI, but why do you ask?"
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Uh no reason.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What do you got in your hand there, bud?"
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Nothing.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it a spider?
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you think taking a spider in an MRI machine will give you super powers?
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, it might work."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"He already bit me a bunch of times, and gave me the power to swell up my hand."
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, my God!"
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,29,Michael,Trevor.
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, Mikey."
3,29,Trevor,"Fancy seeing you down on Earth, completely illegally."
3,29,Trevor,Sweet outfit.
3,29,Trevor,Dick Tracy called.
3,29,Trevor,He said you're a buttface and he's been plowing your mom.
3,29,Michael,"Yeah, well, Dick Tracy called me too, first, and he said he was about to call you, and say a lie about me that was actually true about you, instead."
3,29,Michael,Whatever.
3,29,Michael,"What are you doing here, Trevor?"
3,29,Trevor,"Shawn hacked the Judge's system and we caught you cheating, getting your four little cockroaches to meet up."
3,29,Trevor,"What, you think we were just going to sit around in the Bad Place blowin' beefers while you're down on Earth boning us in the meathole?"
3,29,Michael,So why didn't Shawn just go to the Judge and turn me in?
3,29,Trevor,"Because this way's more fun, knucklenuts."
3,29,Michael,"First of all, I'm currently formulating a better comeback to your Dick Tracy burn, and it's gonna devastate you."
3,29,Michael,"Second, you're too late, because when I did this experiment in my neighborhood, every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help, their bond became unbreakable, and the entire group improved."
3,29,Trevor,"No, you're right."
3,29,Trevor,"There's no way I'll get one of these bozos to drop out of an unpaid, rigorous academic study, especially when they're doing it with me, their over-eager new best friend."
3,29,Trevor,"Well, I should head back."
3,29,Trevor,You want to come with?
3,29,Trevor,"Oh, right, they've all seen you already, so you can't show your face to them again, so you're powerless to stop me."
3,29,Trevor,"Later days, dingus."
3,29,Michael,Dick Tracy called back on his watch phone and said you better watch out.
3,29,Michael,Shoot.
3,29,Michael,A second too late.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, Simone's gotta analyze the scans, so why don't the rest of you head home?"
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Good first day, everyone."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, teach, um, do you think maybe we could continue the one-on-one lessons on the side?"
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I feel like last week I had my own personal ninja master, and now I'm taking tai chi with a bunch of farting housewives."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Between the new project and my classes, I won't have time."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,But this is way better.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"You're still gonna learn a lot, and you'll have a fun group of people to study with outside of class."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,But --
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, gang."
3,29,Trevor,I just had a neat idea.
3,29,Trevor,Let's all go sightseeing.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Dope!
3,29,Trevor,Yeah.
3,29,Trevor,"We can check out Sydney, get to know each other, bond."
3,29,Trevor,"What do you say, E Street Band?"
3,29,Trevor,"Ya up for a Segway tour of Australia, mate?"
3,29,Trevor,This is a knife on the barbie.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool idea.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just worried that maybe it's too cool?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think I'm just gonna find the nearest bar, have one or eight drinks and hit the hay."
3,29,Trevor,Even better.
3,29,Trevor,We'll all go bend an elbow.
3,29,Trevor,"Actually, I know the perfect place for homesick Americans."
3,29,Hortense,"Hi, dudes."
3,29,Hortense,Welcome to the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet.
3,29,Trevor,"Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table?"
3,29,Trevor,They absolutely nailed the swamp stench.
3,29,Hortense,Oh.
3,29,Hortense,Someone's seated there.
3,29,Hortense,"But if you purchase our Manifest Destiny package for $30, you can have anyone you want forcibly removed from the table."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll just sit anywhere.
3,29,Hortense,"When your table's ready, this gun will go off."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I think this is real.
3,29,Trevor,"So, listen up, y'all."
3,29,Trevor,I was so excited to join the group that I made sweatshirts.
3,29,Trevor,You get a sweatshirt.
3,29,Trevor,You get a sweatshirt.
3,29,Trevor,You get a sweatshirt.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,I get a sweatshirt.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"""The Brain-y Bunch""."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Awesome!
3,29,Jason Mendoza,I love being on teams.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"And if we're on a team now, we need nicknames."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz uh, Megatron."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,That's what you can each call me.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Now we need nicknames for you guys.
3,29,Trevor,"Oh, this is the best!"
3,29,Trevor,"I'm gonna get the first round, and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor, the reason we're all here!"
3,29,Trevor,"Yay, Eleanor!"
3,29,Janet,"Well, if you guys are celebrating, I recommend the jalapeno poppers."
3,29,Janet,"Hi, there."
3,29,Janet,I'm Janet.
3,29,Janet,I'll be taking care of you tonight.
3,29,Janet,Can I get you started with some drinks?
3,29,Janet,Our specialty cocktail tonight is the 4th of July.
3,29,Janet,"It's half an apple pie, blended with Southern Comfort and Coca-Cola, served in a Chevy hubcap."
3,29,Trevor,Why don't you just go get us a round of beers?
3,29,Janet,Of course.
3,29,Janet,Here you go.
3,29,Janet,Sorry.
3,29,Janet,"I will go physically pick those up, I guess, and then walk them back here with my feet."
3,29,Janet,"But just so you know, I will be here all night, watching everything that you order."
3,29,Trevor,"So, Ellie baby, brainstorm."
3,29,Trevor,We should get a house.
3,29,Trevor,"Me, you, Tahani, Jason."
3,29,Trevor,We should all go in together on a place.
3,29,Trevor,Roomies!
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Roomies!
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That is technically, an idea."
3,29,Trevor,I think it would be supes fun.
3,29,Trevor,We could play pranks on each other
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,29,Trevor, for my vlog.
3,29,Trevor,We could do one of those ice bucket challenges that
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think so.
3,29,Trevor, I sent you.
3,29,Trevor,Or maybe just a Harlem Shake?
3,29,Trevor,I like to cook and I have been
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Please, stop."
3,29,Trevor, dying to experiment with
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Please stop now.
3,29,Trevor," Jamaican food, man."
3,29,Trevor,I like the Jamaican food.
3,29,Trevor,Listen to the reggae and smoke da joints.
3,29,Trevor,That's a Jamaican accent.
3,29,Janet,"Come on, come on, come on!"
3,29,Michael,"Hey, how's it going?"
3,29,Janet,"Not good, Michael."
3,29,Janet,I don't have my powers.
3,29,Janet,I can't summon things.
3,29,Janet,Dictionary.
3,29,Janet,Spaghetti.
3,29,Janet,Jet Ski.
3,29,Janet,Giraffe.
3,29,Janet,Gah!
3,29,Janet,Look what I've been reduced to.
3,29,Janet,"Humans only live 80 years, and they spend so much of it just waiting for things to be over."
3,29,Michael,"I'm all out of sorts down here, too."
3,29,Michael,I'm bad at lying now.
3,29,Michael,That used to be my thing.
3,29,Michael,And every part of my body is either too dry or too wet.
3,29,Janet,"It's worse for me, man."
3,29,Janet,"Ever since we walked through that portal, my knowledge has stopped updating."
3,29,Janet,"The instant before we left, a man in Caracas, Venezuela, named Raul Benitez was eating a ham sandwich."
3,29,Janet,Did he finish it?
3,29,Janet,I don't know and it's making me crazy.
3,29,Janet,I gotta find him.
3,29,Michael,"Janet, focus on the mission."
3,29,Michael,We have to get Trevor away from the humans.
3,29,Janet,Okay.
3,29,Trevor,"I'm so glad you came out with us, man."
3,29,Trevor,I just assumed you would think it's unprofessional to be friends with the subjects of your study.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I never thought that."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, I kind of do now."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Should I not be socializing?
3,29,Trevor,I'm sure it's fine.
3,29,Trevor,"I mean, how much harm could it possibly do?"
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Good point.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Such a good point that I'm gonna go think about how good a point that is, over there, by myself, for several minutes."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Excuse me.
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, El-Train, you think with all these new Star Wars movies, they'll finally make a new Spaceballs?"
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry, I'm getting a text and I have to take this."
3,29,Janet,"Okay, everybody, here are your beers, and here is yours oh, no!"
3,29,Janet,Oh!
3,29,Janet,I guess you should go to the bathroom or maybe go home and never come back.
3,29,Trevor,"No worries, I made extra sweatshirts."
3,29,Trevor,"Besides, we're having too much fun to leave."
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, speaking of fun, I know this super-fun drinking game we could play."
3,29,Trevor,"Every time one of you says something that the other can't relate to, you both drink."
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Could be fun.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,I once played a drinking game with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively at their macrobiotic farm with a particularly robust batch of homemade kombucha.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Do I have to drink for every word I don't know?
3,29,Trevor,Up to you.
3,29,Trevor,Just drink.
3,29,Michael,Hey.
3,29,Michael,What happened with Chidi?
3,29,Michael,And where's Eleanor?
3,29,Michael,This is all moving too fast!
3,29,Janet,Can we just take Trevor out?
3,29,Janet,"I don't know if he can die, but I could drop a steamroller on his head."
3,29,Janet,"Aw, darn it."
3,29,Janet,I can't summon things.
3,29,Janet,I guess I could kick him with my soft feet?
3,29,Janet,Earth sucks.
3,29,Michael,"You stay on Trevor, keep interfering with his plan, all right?"
3,29,Michael,I'm gonna do my librarian act and nudge Chidi back to the table.
3,29,Trevor,Ah
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yay!
3,29,Trevor,Yummy!
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You gotta relax, man."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're off the clock.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's just a simple drink with friends at the world's worst restaurant.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"No, but Trevor's right."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I might skew the study by fraternizing with the subjects.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,We can be colleagues.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Associates is pushing it.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"And by even having this conversation, you're becoming my confidant."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I can't have that.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Geez, I kinda thought that before everyone else showed up, you and I were becoming actual friends."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no!"
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,You're right.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,What have I done?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna go to the bar and get you a hot tea.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or a regular-temperature Xanax.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Try not to fall apart.
3,29,Michael,Professor Anagonye?
3,29,Michael,"Oh, yeah, I thought I recognized you."
3,29,Michael,"It's me, the librarian, from the library."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Uh I was just kind of in the middle of something here.
3,29,Michael,"Well, maybe I can help."
3,29,Michael,You know what I like to do in situations like these?
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I haven't told you anything about what I'm going through.
3,29,Michael,Do that first.
3,29,Michael,"Then, I'll tell you what I do in situations such as the one you're about to describe."
3,29,Michael,I've been in every situation because I'm a librarian.
3,29,Michael,Hit me.
3,29,Michael,Go ahead.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mmm.
3,29,Trevor,Ah
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm tired.
3,29,Janet,Does anybody want a gallon of water to sober up?
3,29,Trevor,"No, thanks, sweetheart."
3,29,Trevor,"I just called a car for these two love birds, so why don't you just bring us the check?"
3,29,Trevor,"Oh, and you should smile more."
3,29,Trevor,You'll get bigger tips.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Gosh, you're pretty."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"No, you're pretty."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Pretty beautiful.
3,29,Michael,"If you ask me, Chidi, you need to get back over there, you know, spend time with the team."
3,29,Michael,"Though we do have a saying in the library game, um"
3,29,Michael,"""There's only room for one male subject in an academic study, so keep the one who got there first."""
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Catchy.
3,29,Michael,Gotta go now.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,The closest thing I could find to herbal tea was a root beer I had them throw in the microwave.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't drink that.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I think I'm just gonna head home.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,But you can go and spend time with the others.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, that's not really what I signed up for."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, Tahani is eh."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But Jason, woof."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And Trevor, blech."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're not the reason I flew all the way from Arizona.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm sorry, but this is just how it has to be."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I'll see you tomorrow.
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, E-Dog, get over here."
3,29,Trevor,It's trivia night.
3,29,Trevor,First-round questions are all about Logan Paul.
3,29,Trevor,And you know I'm Lo-gang for life.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Go put your head up your own butt.
3,29,Trevor,What?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,29,Trevor,What?
3,29,Trevor,Oh.
3,29,Trevor,Don't you buttnecks ever give up?
3,29,Janet,"No, and what are you even doing in a bathroom?"
3,29,Janet,"You're a demon, you don't need it."
3,29,Trevor,"I like the smells, and I like putting my hands in the toilet, so everything I touch gets a little bit of poop on it."
3,29,Trevor,"Hey, you guys see what I did out there?"
3,29,Trevor,"I am so good, I got Eleanor to leave a bar early."
3,29,Trevor,Chidi's melting down.
3,29,Trevor,Jason and Tahani just left together.
3,29,Trevor,"If they hook up, she's on the first private jet out of here."
3,29,Trevor,This was too easy.
3,29,Michael,It's gonna take a lot more than that to break up this group.
3,29,Michael,"Why don't you give up, Trevor?"
3,29,Michael,"As long as we're here, you'll never succeed."
3,29,Trevor,"Maybe, but how long will that take?"
3,29,Trevor,"I mean, at some point, the Judge will find out that you're not in your little room watching ticker tape."
3,29,Trevor,Right?
3,29,Trevor,"Tick, tick, tick, tick."
3,29,Trevor,"But, hey, may the worst demon win."
3,29,Trevor,"Good luck, Mikey."
3,29,Trevor,Ah!
3,29,Trevor,Poop hands!
3,29,Trevor,I can't believe you fell for that.
3,29,Simone Garnett,Are you all right?
3,29,Simone Garnett,You didn't sleep at all last night.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I got a solid eight minutes."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Not consecutively, but still, it's fine."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,You're not even that blurry.
3,29,Simone Garnett,"You gotta take it easy, man."
3,29,Simone Garnett,"I mean, you're not sleeping."
3,29,Simone Garnett,Your eye is twitching.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"This study has to be airtight, and this ethical question of friendship with the subjects is weighing on me."
3,29,Simone Garnett,I've done a million of these things.
3,29,Simone Garnett,I promise I'll warn you if you cross any lines.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I don't want to come anywhere near those lines.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I have been waiting my entire career for the right thesis and I am not going to blow it.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I have to keep this professional.
3,29,Simone Garnett,"Fine, but you need to get some rest."
3,29,Simone Garnett,"This morning, you bit into a raw egg like it was an apple."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I thought it was hard-boiled.
3,29,Simone Garnett,"Yeah, but still, the shell."
3,29,Trevor,"This is the best secret-friend handshake, bro."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,And it goes
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Attention, everyone."
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do not look at me.
3,29,Simone Garnett,Oh.
3,29,Simone Garnett,I don't know what to do.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am both overhung and humiliated by my uncouth comportment last night.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please accept these formal letters of apology.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Further apologies for their appearance.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher at 5:00 in the morning.
3,29,Trevor,"So, what happened to you two love birds last night, huh?"
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Frankly, it is none of your business."
3,29,Trevor,Oh.
3,29,Trevor,Sorry.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,But Jason was a perfect gentleman last night.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you so much for getting me home safely.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,I wouldn't blame you should you ostracize me for my boorish behavior.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,You weren't boring.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,You were fun.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Crazy story.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"After you got into the cab, I forgot where I lived, but then I looked across the street and there was a motel."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"And behind that, there was a dumpster."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,I slept in a dumpster.
3,29,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jason.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"No, no, no, it was fine."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,And it was super fun getting to know you.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,"You're the fanciest person I know, next to my friend Ronnie, who drives a limo."
3,29,Jason Mendoza,He's in limos all the time.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,Aw.
3,29,Jason Mendoza,What a life.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"As soon as Eleanor gets here, we'll begin."
3,29,Trevor,"Bad news, prof."
3,29,Trevor,Eleanor might not be coming.
3,29,Trevor,She bailed right after you did last night.
3,29,Trevor,"Seemed like she was having second thoughts about being a part of the Brain-y Bunch, so"
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, that's disappointing in terms of how it affects the study."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"But we press on, like professionals."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, do you think I should --"
3,29,Simone Garnett,Yeah.
3,29,Simone Garnett,And I already called you a car because you should not drive.
3,29,Simone Garnett,It's outside.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Thanks.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Where's outside?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, man."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, literally one second ago, I was at the front desk."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Don't know where I got this.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Anyway, are you coming to class?"
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Eh I just don't think the group thing is for me.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm better when it's one-on-one, and we're both looking at our phones, and I don't know the other person, and we don't talk."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I might just head back to Arizona.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Listen.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,My whole life has been a torture chamber of indecision.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"And now, I'm finally on the path to understanding why, and the only reason that's happening is because you walked into my office, and you said you wanted to be a better person."
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,That was really brave.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, I know we barely know each other, but, please, could you give me three months?"
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Can you give me three months?
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,I am asking you as a friend.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,"See, I just told you I don't like talking."
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,That whole thing could've been sent in a text that I pretended I never saw.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,You did good at talking.
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll come back to class.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Come in!
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,No?
3,29,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna drive you back.
3,29,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,29,Michael,"Hey, Dick Tracy called."
3,29,Michael,He said that I was right about Eleanor and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.
3,29,Trevor,I don't think you understand how that joke works.
3,29,Michael,"Yeah, that doesn't matter."
3,29,Michael,We won.
3,29,Michael,That's the point.
3,29,Trevor,You won squat.
3,29,Trevor,We're gonna get 'em eventually.
3,29,Trevor,I'll just keep chipping away till one of them bails.
3,29,Michael,These four humans are all I care about in the universe.
3,29,Michael,"And there is nothing, and I mean nothing, that's gonna come between me --"
3,29,The Doorman,Oh.
3,29,The Doorman,Cool.
3,29,The Doorman,You're all together.
3,29,The Doorman,The Judge wants to see you.
3,29,Michael,Now?
3,29,Michael,Right now?
3,29,Trevor,"Um like, all of us, or --"
3,29,The Doorman,Yup.
3,29,The Doorman,"So, this is Earth, huh?"
3,29,The Doorman,Whoo.
3,29,The Doorman,Pretty cool.
3,29,Judge,"Michael, how many times did I say you could go down to Earth?"
3,29,Michael,"Actually, you weren't 100% explicit --"
3,29,Judge,One time.
3,29,Judge,"I said you could go down there, save their lives, start the new timeline and then come back here to observe them."
3,29,Judge,"""One time,"" is what I said."
3,29,Judge,Uno.
3,29,Judge,One!
3,29,Trevor,"Your Honor, I have to say, I support you one-hundo percent."
3,29,Trevor,"I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable."
3,29,Trevor,"Now, granted, I also tricked the doorman and snuck down to Earth, but what are we gonna do --"
3,29,Trevor,Ahh!
3,29,Judge,Do you realize what you did?
3,29,Judge,You meddled in human affairs.
3,29,Judge,"That ripples out, man!"
3,29,Judge,Do you know how much weird stuff has happened because of your little experiment?
3,29,Judge,England left Europe.
3,29,Judge,That Hugh Jackman musical about P.T. Barnum?
3,29,Judge,"It made, like, $400 million."
3,29,Judge,"Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars are good now."
3,29,Michael,Impossible.
3,29,Judge,I'm serious!
3,29,Judge,They're gonna make the playoffs.
3,29,Judge,"Blake Bortles is kind of okay, maybe?"
3,29,Judge,I don't know.
3,29,Judge,It's being debated amongst experts.
3,29,Judge,It's confusing.
3,29,Judge,"But whatever it is, it's yo' fault."
3,29,Judge,Your experiment with the humans is over.
3,29,Michael,Are you gonna kill them?
3,29,Judge,No!
3,29,Judge,"But starting now, there is no more monitoring them."
3,29,Judge,They're just regular humans that need to hit the regular point threshold to see if they make it into the Good Place.
3,29,Michael,Hmm.
3,29,Judge,And if they don't
3,29,Judge,"And right now, the two of you are going back to the Bad Place."
3,29,Janet,But they'll retire Michael.
3,29,Janet,And I'll be marbleized.
3,29,Judge,"Well, maybe, you should have thought about that before you intervened in human affairs!"
3,29,Judge,"I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns the Weather Channel now."
3,29,Michael,Is that bad?
3,29,Judge,"I don't know, but it's weird, man!"
3,29,Judge,"Now, come with me."
3,29,Janet,Hey.
3,29,Janet,My powers are back online.
3,29,Janet,This must be everything I tried to summon on Earth.
3,29,Judge,Stop it.
3,29,Janet,I don't think I can.
3,29,Janet,"I'm like a printer, when the print queue suddenly starts processing all the unprinted documents."
3,29,Janet,"Oh, man."
3,29,Janet,"Buckle up, folks."
3,29,Michael,Let's go.
3,29,Michael,Right now.
3,29,Judge,"Janet, make it stop!"
3,29,Judge,"Janet, stop it!"
3,29,Judge,"Janet, this is annoying."
3,29,Judge,Janet!
3,29,The Doorman,"Good luck, frog man."
3,29,The Doorman,Pullin' for ya.
3,29,Judge,"Janet, I know you're still there!"
3,29,The Doorman,They escaped.
3,29,Judge,Yeah.
3,29,Judge,"Thanks, Jeff."
3,30,Michael,Okay.
3,30,Michael,That was an insane thing for us to do.
3,30,Michael,Oh!
3,30,Michael,"Okay, good news, I have the Doorman's key, so no one will be able to come after us."
3,30,Michael,Let's just try to --
3,30,Janet,Your key is ringing.
3,30,Judge,I have a question for you: are you out of your damn mind?
3,30,Michael,"Your Honor, look at it from my point of view."
3,30,Judge,"I have never been this angry in my life, which is the age of the universe!"
3,30,Michael,"I understand, but saving the souls of these four humans is more important, so we're not coming back until we do."
3,30,Judge,"Oh, don't you even try coming back here, 'cause when you walk through that door, I am gonna be waiting for you."
3,30,Michael,"Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up!"
3,30,Judge,That's impossible.
3,30,Judge,"It's a magical key, you dick."
3,30,Judge,What are you doing?
3,30,Judge,I can see you.
3,30,Michael,This is perfect.
3,30,Michael,"We're right near Chidi's office, and as far as I can tell, the whole floor is abandoned."
3,30,Michael,What do they use it for?
3,30,Michael,Storage?
3,30,Janet,"No, this is the journalism department."
3,30,Michael,Ah!
3,30,Michael,"Bad for the world, good for us."
3,30,Michael,"So, somehow, with none of our powers, we have to keep the group intact and monitor their ethical progress."
3,30,Michael,"So, how do we do that?"
3,30,Janet,Not sure.
3,30,Janet,There's no way to track people's actual point totals.
3,30,Janet,Only the accountants have that information.
3,30,Janet,"But I did install cameras and microphones, so at least we can keep our eye on them."
3,30,Janet,Let's get peepin'!
3,30,Janet,"Oh, no."
3,30,Janet,Not a great start.
3,30,Janet,"Eleanor farted, and then she blamed it on her chair."
3,30,Janet,That's gonna cost her at least a few points.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a bolt missing or something.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"Before we begin, Trevor is dropping out of the study."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,He sent me an email last night.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"""I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly and stupid to be in the study, and I'm going home to my mommy."""
3,30,Michael,That was me.
3,30,Michael,I wrote that email.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"That's too bad, but we press on."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,We're on to stage two of the study.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm going to teach you some philosophical principles, and then we will explore how those ideas have affected your personal moral machineries --"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it's my chair."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's got this weird design.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Your chair smells bad.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Another person who agrees it's the chair.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Great news, everyone!"
3,30,Simone Garnett,The funding from the neuroscience department came through!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,And you blew it all on cupcakes?
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Exactly what I would have done.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Respect.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Eleanor?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I'm good."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I try to avoid pointless group activities.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, like office Christmas parties, or jury duty."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"To me, the single most awful sound in the universe is that mangled opening note of your co-workers singing ""Happy Birthday""."
3,30,Simone Garnett,Cool stance.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Counterpoint: these are delicious free cupcakes.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Get over yourself and eat one.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"You guys, let's take a picture!"
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Everyone get in, get in, and say oh, say ""ventromedial pre-frontal cortex""!"
3,30,All,Ventromedial pre-frontal cortex.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Jaguars rule!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, teach?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've been having so much fun here, but I didn't plan to stay in Australia this long, and I'm super broke."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Any idea where I can get a part-time gig?
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,What kind of work are you looking for?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm really good at telemarketing."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can usually guess how long to microwave food without looking at the box.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'd say those are my two main skills.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,Okay!
3,30,Michael,Dang it.
3,30,Michael,"If Eleanor has to get a job, she'll miss class, and that'll slow down her progress."
3,30,Janet,Are you sure we should be doing this?
3,30,Janet,It kind of feels like cheating.
3,30,Michael,"No, no, no, it's not cheating."
3,30,Michael,"Think of us as a snowplow, clearing a path for Eleanor, so she can more easily drive along the road of improvement."
3,30,Janet,"Ooh, I love that!"
3,30,Janet,You really painted a picture there.
3,30,Ken Garoo,G'day.
3,30,Ken Garoo,How can I help you?
3,30,Michael,"One scratch-off lottery ticket, please."
3,30,Janet,"Oh, not that one."
3,30,Janet,"Keep going, keep going, keep going."
3,30,Janet,These tickets were printed before we got down here.
3,30,Janet,I know which ones are the winners.
3,30,Janet,And stop!
3,30,Janet,That's the one!
3,30,Janet,Good ol' lucky number 186 from the bottom!
3,30,Ken Garoo,Here you go.
3,30,Janet,"Also, that bathroom key that you lost nine months ago slid under the register."
3,30,Janet,And the woman that you think is your aunt is actually your mom.
3,30,Janet,"Okay, bye!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You guys, this is nuts!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This morning, I found a lottery ticket on the ground outside my apartment."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I scratched it off, and I won $18,000!"
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,Wow!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,That's amazing!
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Better luck next time.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, sorry, from context, I see that is actually a large sum of money."
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Jason, you okay there, mate?"
3,30,Jason Mendoza,No.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"I have to watch the Jaguar games alone, on my computer, at, like, 3:00 in the morning, on Mondays."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,It's so annoying.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"Everything here is in a I don't know how to describe it like, a different zone of time."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"No, that sounds stupid."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,A different clock land.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll watch the game with you, Jason!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I enjoy American football.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I actually dated a player once.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But he wasn't my type, so I set him up with my friend Gisele Bundchen."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we got it."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,We always get it.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Awesome!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"But if you want to watch with me, you have to learn my Jaguars cheer."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"It goes, ""Let's go, Jags!"
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Kick their ass!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah!"""
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Do you think you can learn that by the weekend?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I shall do my best.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Nice!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,See you then!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why do you want to watch football with Jason.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I don't, really."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But I am, these days, as you might say in America, ""mad horny""."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
3,30,Michael,"Oh, boy."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, no judgements, babe."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's a straight hottie.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You want to smash Jason, go smash."
3,30,Michael,"Tahani getting together with Jason, even casually, could tear this group apart."
3,30,Michael,We have to nip this in the bud.
3,30,Janet,"Well, it makes me slightly uneasy to interfere in the personal life of the man that I am secretly in love with and a woman I admire, but if you think we should, I'm not gonna argue."
3,30,Michael,"Time to break out the ol' snowplow again, Janet."
3,30,Michael,"Let's find Tahani a loving, supportive companion."
3,30,Janet,Great idea.
3,30,Michael,"You know, this is not as crucial to the mission, but I'd also love to arrange for them to get better computers."
3,30,Michael,Help them work faster.
3,30,Janet,"If I'm going to the mall anyway, I might as well pick Jason up some jean shorts, the kind with the frayed edges, where you can see the pockets coming out the bottom?"
3,30,Janet,So that he can study better.
3,30,Michael,Sure.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Tahani?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Is that you?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Larry Hemsworth?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,My goodness!
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"That's so funny, I just got a call from the restaurant about a jacket I left here, and now here you are!"
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I can't believe you remember me.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course I remember you.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,We dated.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"I know, I just never expect anyone to remember me."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"Because I'm only 6'4"" and I have one of those forgettable faces."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"Well, uh, I'm sure you're busy, probably don't want to talk to me."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I get it.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"I wouldn't either, I'm as dull as a rock."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Ugh!
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Even that analogy was boring.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"I'm sorry, I'm so dull and ugly, I'm like a rock."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Stupid Larry!
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Stop talking about rocks!
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no, no, Larry, please!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's lovely to see you.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sit down.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's catch up!
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"How are Chris, and Liam and Luke?"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I won't mention your brothers again."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,As long as you don't mention my sister!
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Oh!
3,30,Janet,Mmm-mmm!
3,30,Monty,Who are you?
3,30,Monty,Do you work here?
3,30,Janet,Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.
3,30,Janet,"Your ex-wife Samantha still loves you, but she's afraid to call."
3,30,Janet,You must show her your poetry.
3,30,Janet,Go to her.
3,30,Janet,Go to her!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Looks like you had a good night!
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You and Jason, imagine that."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"To be fair, I have."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I ran into him unexpectedly and the reunion was a smashing success.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's a pun, you see."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,We had intercourse.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, again, I always get it."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I do feel bad, though."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I completely forgot about watching the game with Jason.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"Homies, guess what?"
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"Yesterday, I got a Facebook invite to the Australia chapter of the Jacksonville Jaguars fan club!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I think he's over it."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Me and two other dudes just watched the Jags annihilate the Texans.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,It was super fun!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,I'm completely wasted.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"I gotta go barf one last time, and then I'll be ready to learn philosophy!"
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Duval!
3,30,Janet,"Okay, not perfect, but the pros outweigh the cons."
3,30,Michael,Agreed.
3,30,All,"Happy birthday, dear Chidi"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You guys, this whole year has been amazing for all of us."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, literally every aspect of our lives has improved."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I don't know about every aspect."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"SuperBoard, activate!"
3,30,Automated Voice,"Good morning, Professor Anagonye."
3,30,Automated Voice,I have your lesson plan ready to go.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"SuperBoard, some triumphant announcement music, please."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me and we're moving back to London to begin planning the wedding!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy smokes!
3,30,Michael,Janet!
3,30,Michael,Red alert!
3,30,Michael,All snowplowing has to stop immediately.
3,30,Janet,"So, don't give Blake Beartles to Jason?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,How are you even lugging this thing around?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not sure I could bench this much weight.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, girls in my social class begin ring-training at a very young age."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party tonight at my Airbnb."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's very last minute.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come as you are.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,I guess all these people came as they were?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, everyone."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm so glad you made it.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Holy crap, Tahani, you found this place on Airbnb?"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I see why you're confused.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I used Heirbnb.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""H-E-I-R""."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's an app for heirs and heiresses where we swap mansions, private islands, blimp hangers, that sort of thing."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, everyone, I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Oh!
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,The legendary study group.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I'm sorry it's taken me so long to build up the courage to meet you.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I guess you can see why.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he ashamed at having a perfect jawline and zero percent body fat?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Still can't believe she wants to marry me.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"A dumb, old pediatric surgeon who barely has an eight-pack."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,Do you know what you look like?
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"More importantly, did Miley Cyrus write the song ""Wrecking Ball"" about Chris' brother Liam?"
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Wonderful.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,More questions about my talented brothers.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,God forbid there's a single day where I'm the special one.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sweetheart, don't go!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You're important, too!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fixing babies' spines is just as valuable as acting.
3,30,Michael,Tahani booked a flight for tomorrow morning so this party is our only chance to talk them out of moving.
3,30,Janet,Maybe we should just let them go their separate ways and hope that they learned enough to get into the Good Place.
3,30,Michael,"No, we know what'll happen."
3,30,Michael,"If the group splits up, they're screwed."
3,30,Michael,"No, we have to isolate Larry and convince him that he needs to stay in Australia."
3,30,Michael,"Time to get into character as Nathaniel Cookswell, mate!"
3,30,Michael,Caterer to the stars!
3,30,Janet,Huh maybe no accent?
3,30,Michael,Fine.
3,30,Janet,Vegemite canape?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Might as well.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Mummy was right.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I'll always be the chubby one.
3,30,Michael,"Good day, mate."
3,30,Michael,"Nathaniel Cookswell, caterer to the stars."
3,30,Michael,Is it true you're moving to England?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Yeah.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Fly out tomorrow.
3,30,Michael,"Oh, that's a long trip."
3,30,Michael,"Well, you must be a confident man, uprooting your life like that."
3,30,Janet,You should stay here in Sydney.
3,30,Janet,"It's such a dynamic, international city that you've only seen 4.8% of probably."
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,I reckon I know what's going on here.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"You aren't real caterers, are you?"
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Who do you work for?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Australian Inquirer?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,TMZ?
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,You just want us to stay here so you can keep mocking me.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"""The hideous shame of the Hemsworth family."""
3,30,Janet,Oh.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,Tahani sees through all that.
3,30,Larry Hemsworth,"And I can't wait until we move far away from the likes of you, and I can finally take her last name."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hate to say it, but the group probably needs a new member."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know how we'll ever replace Tahani.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you think Margot Robbie's into philosophy?
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, Tahani's announcement made us take stock."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, Simone and I need time to analyze the data, apply for grants."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,We've kind of hit a natural stopping point.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat the experiment with new subjects, you know, compare results."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, what are you saying?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,That the study's over?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're splitting up?
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"We're just taking a break, for a year or so."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,And I'm sure you're all anxious to get back home.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to get back to in Phoenix."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like I have a free punch-card at my spray tan place.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They'll do my left side for free, so"
3,30,Michael,"No, no, no, no!"
3,30,Michael,The whole group is splintering!
3,30,Michael,"Okay, new emergency plan."
3,30,Michael,I'll deal with Eleanor.
3,30,Michael,"I know it's risky, but I don't think she'll recognize me."
3,30,Janet,And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks.
3,30,Janet,"I mean, Jason's butt."
3,30,Janet,"I mean, Jason."
3,30,Michael,Shrimp?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Always.
3,30,Michael,So how do you know Miss Al-Jamil?
3,30,Michael,You work with her at the university?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Used to.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,That study is done-zo.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I was finally starting to figure things out, and now I have to start over from scratch."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Again.
3,30,Michael,"Boy, I know how that goes."
3,30,Michael,Not wanting something to end.
3,30,Michael,"Feeling like your little team is the last thing standing between you and oblivion, that at any moment the universe could fold up around you and squeeze the last breath from your dying lungs."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a caterer, right?"
3,30,Michael,It's a very competitive industry.
3,30,Michael,"The point is, I bet that if the study means that much to you, it means a lot to everyone else."
3,30,Michael,You're all just probably waiting for someone to say it out loud.
3,30,Michael,You want some cocktail sauce with that?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,I would like to acknowledge the wonderful group of people who brought me here.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If I hadn't decided to get out of the spotlight of my ""Get Out of the Spotlight"" tour, and come here and join the Brainy Brunch, I never would have reconnected with Larry."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, to celebrate our group, I had my favorite patissier whip this up!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Would any of you like to say a few words?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor!
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yay, Eleanor!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If nobody minds, uh I would like to address the people on this cake, I suppose."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I get that we all have meaningful lives outside the study.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, Tahani and Chidi do."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Jason and I are straight trash.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Ka-kaw!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,But just think about how much progress we've all made since that picture was taken.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know that what we're doing is important and I'm not ready to stop.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I don't think you guys are, either."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, let's all stay here and keep it going."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you say?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, that was absolutely lovely."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,It really was.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,And I am I'm so glad that this study meant that much to you.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"But, realistically"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's cool.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I get it.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you don't need to say it."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got it.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's all she wrote.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,Are you okay?
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,I hope you're not mad.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm not mad."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm actually laughing.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because this whole study was a hilarious, stupid, pointless joke, and now it's over, so let's hit the road."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't need you guys.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't need me.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And since you don't need me, I'm just gonna take the me out of this cake."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no!"
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, please!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry, the deed is done!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Pip pip, too late!"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Farewell to you, my liege."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,And a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day to all of you!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,USA!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,USA!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,USA!
3,30,Simone Garnett,Eleanor?
3,30,Simone Garnett,Is that you?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Called a cab, like, 20 minutes ago."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It says it's ten kilometers away, which is I don't even know how far."
3,30,Simone Garnett,It's a little over six miles.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is that why you came out here?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,To scold me about the metric system?
3,30,Simone Garnett,"No, I was about to call a cab myself."
3,30,Simone Garnett,I have an early class tomorrow.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Then I saw my friend hiding behind a plant and I got concerned.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Then my friend lashed out at me again, so I'm gonna take off and leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, wait, wait."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't go.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're a brain scientist.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you tell me why I did that in there?
3,30,Simone Garnett,I mostly do clinical research in neuroscience.
3,30,Simone Garnett,I don't really specialize in temper tantrums.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Maybe you need a child psychologist or a binkie.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's a solid burn.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I deserved it.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, please, can you help me?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why did I do that?
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Okay, here's my guess."
3,30,Simone Garnett,"As humans evolved, the first big problem we had to overcome was ""me versus us""."
3,30,Simone Garnett,Learning to sacrifice a little individual freedom for the benefit of a group.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"You know, like sharing food and resources so we don't starve or get eaten by tigers, things like that."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, with you so far."
3,30,Simone Garnett,"The next problem to overcome was ""us versus them""."
3,30,Simone Garnett,Trying to see other groups different from ours as equals.
3,30,Simone Garnett,That one we're still struggling with.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"That's why we have racism, and nationalism and why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin hate fans of The Rock."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We hate The Rock because he went Hollywood and Stone Cold keeps it real, so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Point made, keep going."
3,30,Simone Garnett,"Well, what's interesting about you is I don't think you ever got past the ""me versus us"" stage."
3,30,Simone Garnett,"I mean, have you ever been part of a group that you really cared about?"
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was in the Girl Scouts.
3,30,Simone Garnett,Really?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Technically, I joined under a fake name, because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies."
3,30,Simone Garnett,See?
3,30,Simone Garnett,"The Brainy Bunch is basically the first group that became part of your self identity, and now that's breaking up, you're feeling this new kind of loss."
3,30,Simone Garnett,And you're scared of going back to being alone.
3,30,Simone Garnett,"I mean, that's just my guess."
3,30,Simone Garnett,The other possible medical diagnosis is that you're just a bit of a dick.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you take my cab?
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think ""me"" needs to go apologize to ""us""."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,And thank you.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The point is, I'm not really an ""I'm sorry"" type girl."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm more of a ""It's your fault your car got keyed in the movie theater parking lot, because you wouldn't shut up while watching John Wick"" type girl."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I'm sorry that I freaked out.
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just really gonna miss you guys.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,"We're gonna miss you, too."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,Here's an idea.
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,What if we all agree to a yearly reunion?
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And then that way, the Brainy Bunch never dies."
3,30,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Each summer, we could all stay in one of our respective houses, mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you."
3,30,Jason Mendoza,We should all meet up in Jacksonville!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,My house is right on the water.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,"It didn't used to be, but the whole city is a swamp and it's sinking into the ocean."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Strong pitch, bud."
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,Next year in Jacksonville!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,Yeah!
3,30,Jason Mendoza,We might not want to wait a whole year.
3,30,Jason Mendoza,It's sinking really fast.
3,30,Chidi Anagonye,We should have a toast.
3,30,Michael,"Okay, I think I figured out a plan where they stay in Australia, and only five random bystanders get hurt."
3,30,Michael,It's called arson.
3,30,Michael,Let's go!
3,30,Janet,"Michael, no."
3,30,Janet,We can't keep meddling forever.
3,30,Janet,It's time to park the snowplow and trust that the humans will make progress on their own.
3,30,Janet,"This isn't like your afterlife neighborhood, Michael."
3,30,Janet,You can't just reset things the moment something doesn't go according to your plan.
3,30,Michael,"Oh, Janet, you're a genius."
3,30,Janet,Correct.
3,30,Janet,I know everything.
3,30,Michael,You just gave me this crazy idea.
3,30,Michael,"It's so crazy, it just might fail."
3,30,Michael,It'll probably fail.
3,30,Michael,But it also might work.
3,30,Michael,I open the door to the afterlife.
3,30,Michael,You keep a lookout while I break into the Judge's chamber and reset the timeline on Earth.
3,30,Michael,"We do it all over again, but correctly."
3,30,Michael,We won't wait a year to get them all together again.
3,30,Michael,We'll get the study going right away!
3,30,Janet,But do you even know how to reset the timeline on Earth?
3,30,Michael,No.
3,30,Michael,"I'm assuming that there's, you know, a knob, or a button or, you know maybe you unplug it and then plug it right back in?"
3,30,Michael,I don't there's gotta be a way!
3,30,Janet,"Michael, before you do this --"
3,30,Michael,No!
3,30,Michael,No more waiting.
3,30,Michael,"This is all we have, Janet."
3,30,Michael,"We have Chidi, and Eleanor, and Tahani and Jason, and that is it."
3,30,Michael,"If we can't get them enough afterlife points to get them into the Good Place, then there's no point in us even being here."
3,30,Michael,We have to try.
3,30,Janet,Okay.
3,30,Janet,Let's do this.
3,30,Michael,"Yeah, okay."
3,30,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the hell is that?
3,30,Michael,Oh!
3,30,Michael,"Hey, guys!"
3,30,Michael,What are you doing down here?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the hell is that?
3,31,Michael,Oh!
3,31,Michael,"Hey, guys."
3,31,Michael,What are you doing down here?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, we came to get more champagne, which is right behind the magic door."
3,31,Michael,What door?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's going on?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you and why were you talking about us?
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,And what's the Good Place and what are afterlife points?
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And who has the most, and is it me?"
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Wait a second, I know this guy."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,You're Zack Pizazz.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,He got me here from Jacksonville.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"No, this is the librarian from the university."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo, a very rude Silicon Valley investor."
3,31,Michael,"All right, guys, I can explain everything."
3,31,Michael,"Just give me one second, okay?"
3,31,Michael,How do we get out of this?
3,31,Janet,"Well, they heard us explaining the entire system of the afterlife, and they saw an interdimensional door open and close, so not a ton of wiggle room here."
3,31,Michael,But you're forgetting one crucial piece of information.
3,31,Michael,Right?
3,31,Michael,"I mean, you're forgetting one crucial piece of information that'll save us?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yo, buddy."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You have like three seconds to explain this crazy space door, or Chidi here is gonna beat you up."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,But I would like to know about the space door.
3,31,Michael,All right.
3,31,Michael,I don't know what choice we have.
3,31,Michael,I'll tell you the truth.
3,31,Michael,"My name is Special Agent Rick Justice and this is Lisa ""Frenchy"" Fuqua."
3,31,Michael,"We're with the FBI, and all of you are in grave danger."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,I knew it.
3,31,Michael,Agent Fuqua and I are paranormal investigators.
3,31,Michael,We're here to protect you from demons.
3,31,Michael,"No, wait, that's real."
3,31,Michael,"Um, ghouls ghouls."
3,31,Michael,We're here to protect you from ghouls.
3,31,Michael,"Now, I had to appear in different disguises to keep tabs on you, but you are all involved together in this FBI case."
3,31,Michael,"No, we can prove this."
3,31,Michael,We have detailed files on all of you.
3,31,Michael,Ask Janet anything.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's Janet?
3,31,Michael,Frenchy.
3,31,Janet,Frenchy.
3,31,Michael,Sorry.
3,31,Michael,Frenchy's nickname is Janet.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I thought her nickname was Frenchy.
3,31,Michael,It is.
3,31,Michael,"That's why they call her Lisa ""Double Nickname"" Fuqua."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, guys, I used to work at a place that was raided by the FBI pretty frequently."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know a fed when I see one.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,And these two jamokes are not FBI.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really.
3,31,Michael,"All right, all right."
3,31,Michael,Fine.
3,31,Michael,Just give me one more second.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,One.
3,31,Michael,Serious question?
3,31,Janet,Yep?
3,31,Michael,Should we kill them?
3,31,Janet,What?
3,31,Michael,It might work.
3,31,Michael,"We kill them, go back through the door, somehow grab them before they get to the Bad Place and regroup from there."
3,31,Michael,I could kill them right now.
3,31,Michael,"And, you know, it would be easy."
3,31,Michael,Their bodies are very poorly made.
3,31,Michael,They're mostly goo and juice.
3,31,Michael,You just take the juice out and then they're dead.
3,31,Janet,"Michael, they've seen through the door into the afterlife, and they heard how it works."
3,31,Janet,It's over.
3,31,Michael,Ah.
3,31,Michael,Fine.
3,31,Michael,I guess I'll start at the beginning.
3,31,Michael,You all died.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, this sucks."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"So, to sum up."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,There is a heaven and hell.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"We've been to hell, and now, no matter how good we are for the rest of our lives, we're going back to hell."
3,31,Michael,"Again, it's not the classic Christian hell, but that's the gist, yes."
3,31,Michael,"As soon as you learned about the afterlife, your motivation to be good was corrupted, so you can't earn points anymore."
3,31,Michael,So sorry for eternally dooming you.
3,31,Janet,"And that's our bad, guys."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, all the attempts you made to torture us, we must have been in the afterlife for 100 years."
3,31,Michael,"Almost 300, actually."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"How is it possible that all these things happened to us, but no time passed on Earth?"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Did you go back in time to save us?
3,31,Michael,"Ah, I didn't have to because of Jeremy Bearimy."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Who's Jeremy Bearimy?
3,31,Michael,"Okay, things in the afterlife don't happen while things are happening here because while time on Earth moves in a straight line one thing happens, then the next, then the next."
3,31,Michael,Time in the afterlife moves in a Jeremy Bearimy.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,31,Michael,"In the afterlife, time doubles back and loops around and ends up looking something like Jeremy Bearimy."
3,31,Michael,This is the timeline in the afterlife.
3,31,Michael,"Happens to kinda look like the name Jeremy Bearimy in cursive English, so that's what we call it."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, I'm my brain is melting."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,How can events happen before the ones that happened before?
3,31,Michael,Just the way it works.
3,31,Michael,It's Jeremy Bearimy.
3,31,Michael,I don't know what to tell you.
3,31,Michael,That's the easiest way to describe it.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, but what the hell is this?"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"The dot over the ""I""."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,The hell is that?
3,31,Michael,Okay.
3,31,Michael,How do I explain this concisely?
3,31,Michael,This is Tuesdays and also July.
3,31,Janet,And sometimes it's never.
3,31,Michael,That's true.
3,31,Michael,"Occasionally, that moment on the Bearimy timeline is the time-moment when nothing never occurs."
3,31,Michael,So you get it.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,This broke me.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"The dot over the ""I""."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,That broke me.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'm I'm done.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm glad this whole thing happened.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because now I can go back to living my life the way I used to: only caring about myself because being good is pointless.
3,31,Michael,"No, no."
3,31,Michael,"Please, Eleanor --"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, thank you."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm outtie.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,See ya in hell.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, I just realized, I always say that when leaving a room, but right now, it's accurate."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I will literally see all of you in hell!
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Not if I see you first!
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Let's go, Jason."
3,31,Michael,"No, no, look, look."
3,31,Michael,"You guys, this is not over."
3,31,Michael,We have to stay together.
3,31,Michael,"Look, we'll figure something out."
3,31,Michael,"Like, this one idea I had, I could kill all of you."
3,31,Janet,That's my birthday.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, buddy, it's my birthday."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One free margarita, please."
3,31,Lod Raver,"Well, happy birthday!"
3,31,Lod Raver,Can I just see some ID?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,31,Lod Raver,Why not?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, because it's not really my birthday."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just want a free margarita.
3,31,Lod Raver,"Well, if I just randomly gave you a free drink, I'd have to do it for everyone."
3,31,Lod Raver,"Pretty soon, I'd go out of business."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then don't do it for everyone.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just do it for me.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because it's my birthday!
3,31,Lod Raver,Happy birthday.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, I have an idea, but it's a little risky."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I need you to act as my bodyguard.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like my friend Kevin Costner in that movie where he was a bodyguard.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Bodyguard.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,No problem.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,My cousin once hired me to do crowd control for his off-brand Sea World.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Well, technically, it was just a bunch of kiddie pools full of jellyfish."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"And instead of a killer whale, they killed a whale."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Excuse me, miss."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"We'd like to buy one opera, please."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, what he means is I would like to give $2 million to the Sydney Opera."
3,31,Cat Pash,"Miss Al-Jamil, this is so generous."
3,31,Cat Pash,"With a donation of that size, we will dedicate a rehearsal hall in your honor."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thank you, but no."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection of wings and atria, the gift will be anonymous."
3,31,Cat Pash,As you wish.
3,31,Cat Pash,I'll draw up the papers.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Why don't you want your name on the opera house?
3,31,Jason Mendoza,I love getting my name on stuff.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"In Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named after me 'cause I kissed a bat on a dare."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I was thinking about why I was sent to hell, as one is wont to do when one has recently been told that one had been sent to hell."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,And it occurred to me.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I have always been held captive by my desire for attention.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now that I know how it all ends, I just want to be virtuous for virtue's sake."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,That's beautiful.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"I gotta say though, if you want to do more charity, I know a way that could be a lot of fun."
3,31,Damon,Hey.
3,31,Damon,Do you wanna talk to God?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"""God is dead."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,God remains dead.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,And we have killed him.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Who will wipe this blood off us?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent?"""
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882."
3,31,Damon,I was just trying to sell you some drugs and you made it weird.
3,31,Janet,I've never written a manifesto before.
3,31,Janet,What are you gonna say?
3,31,Michael,"It'll be a complete account of everything we've learned, from the beginning of my neighborhood to right now."
3,31,Michael,And then a recommendation of how we feel the afterlife could be improved.
3,31,Michael,"And then we turn ourselves in, we'll give it to the Judge."
3,31,Michael,Hopefully she'll read it.
3,31,Michael,"We failed, Janet, but maybe one day, someone else will succeed."
3,31,Michael,"Okay, so A man i fes to."
3,31,Michael,"By Mi where's the ""H""?"
3,31,Michael,"This keyboard doesn't have an ""H""."
3,31,Janet,Well --
3,31,Michael,"Wait, wait."
3,31,Michael,I see it.
3,31,Michael,I see it.
3,31,Michael,Oh!
3,31,Michael,"No, no."
3,31,Michael,Look what I did!
3,31,Janet,Yeah.
3,31,Michael,"I wrote ""Micahel""."
3,31,Michael,"That's okay, back, back, back, back, back."
3,31,Janet,Maybe you should dictate and I should type.
3,31,Michael,Good call.
3,31,Janet,Just laying out some early details.
3,31,Janet,Go ahead and start dictating.
3,31,Lod Raver,"Look, there have to be rules."
3,31,Lod Raver,Every place has rules.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Here are my rules.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Rule number one: I get to do whatever I want, and you all just have to deal with it."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Rule two: no more Spider-Man movies.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's way too many Spider-Man movies.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Too many dorky, little, twerpy Spider-men."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Rule three: everyone, leave me alone."
3,31,Lod Raver,"So you just take care of yourself, you don't owe anything to anyone else?"
3,31,Lod Raver,"If people lived that way, society would break down."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In America, everyone does whatever they want."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Society did break down.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's terrible and it's great!
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You only look out for number one, scream at whoever disagrees with you, there are no bees because they all died, and if you need surgery, you just beg for money on the Internet."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a perfect system!
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, get me another drink."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tomorrow's my birthday.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, well, well, a wallet."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"My rules say I get to take the cash out and keep it, because in my society, I do whatever I want 'cause I'm awesome."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just take it.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Take it, Eleanor."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just
3,31,Mark Supial,"All right, this is the address on the license."
3,31,Mark Supial,That'll be 58 bucks.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Keep the meter running.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"As soon as I'm done here, I'm gonna head to the airport, get the hell out of this trash country where everyone is either a criminal or a spider."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, ma'am."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a Fred Booth here?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I found his wallet, and now I'm doing a nice thing and returning it because I suck."
3,31,Nicole Mankid,"Sorry, he moved."
3,31,Nicole Mankid,I can give you his new address if you'd like.
3,31,Nicole Mankid,"Actually, I have some of his mail."
3,31,Nicole Mankid,"If you're gonna go see him, could you bring it along?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I would love to bring some rando his mail.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Anything else you want me to schlep over?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, this awesome day gets awesomer."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Before the airport, we're heading to 78 Palmer Street."
3,31,Mark Supial,Ha!
3,31,Mark Supial,That's right next to the bar I picked you up.
3,31,Mark Supial,I feel like a bloody boomerang.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course you do!
3,31,Waomi Natts,Uh
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Hello.
3,31,Waomi Natts,"Sir, you can't shop here without a shirt."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,31,Gvonne Eoolagong,"So, that'll be $880."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Here's my credit card.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Why don't you just charge it and keep it forever?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"And also, here's the keys to my car."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, do you guys have, like, a ""take a car, leave a car"" tray?"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,No?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, just take it."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Just take it.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Excuse me, sir."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Would you like some free money?
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Now you can buy fingers for your gloves.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, madam."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Are you poor?
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Here's $5,000 for a new stroller."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Have a nice day.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"You don't have to say the ""are you poor"" part."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Right.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Here's some money.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Here you go.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Here you go.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,This was a truly great plan.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Aww, thanks."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Man, there's so many times that just this amount of money would've changed my life."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,I could've paid my rent.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"I could've gone to a real doctor instead of pretending I was a big dog, so I could go to the vet."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, that gives me an idea, which I suppose, one could argue, means that anything could've given me an idea."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Come with me.
3,31,Gel Mibson,"I'm sorry, Miss Al-Jamil, but I just don't feel comfortable processing this request."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why not?
3,31,Gel Mibson,"Well, it just seems a bit odd to transfer the totality of your account, 131 million British pounds, to the account of this person, a man who is so flagrantly ignoring the ""one lollipop per customer"" rule."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,No.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"I walked out and back in each time, so I'm different customers."
3,31,Gel Mibson,We're technically supposed to shut down the bank if anyone from Florida even walks in.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, all my life, this money has been a weight around my neck."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like the Heart of the Ocean necklace my friend James Cameron once gave me.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't want the money.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,My friend Jason does.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I would like to give it to him.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"If it's easier, you can just put it on a GameStop gift card."
3,31,Gel Mibson,That does not make it easier.
3,31,Gel Mibson,I can't help you.
3,31,Gel Mibson,I'm sorry.
3,31,Fred Booth,Good day.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fred?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have all your crap.
3,31,Fred Booth,Thank you.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,And your wallet.
3,31,Fred Booth,"Oh, my goodness!"
3,31,Fred Booth,Thank you so much.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was nothing.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, I didn't take your money."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I would never even think of doing that.
3,31,Fred Booth,"No, no, no."
3,31,Fred Booth,I'm not worried about that.
3,31,Fred Booth,Ah!
3,31,Fred Booth,Here it is.
3,31,Fred Booth,"I started a new job a few months ago and I got really nervous, so my daughter Carolyn drew this for me to make me feel better."
3,31,Fred Booth,It's my good luck charm.
3,31,Fred Booth,"Every time I'm stressed at work now, I just have to look at this, and I feel safe."
3,31,Fred Booth,"Look, a lot of people wouldn't have tried so hard to get this to me."
3,31,Fred Booth,"You are a good person, Eleanor."
3,31,Fred Booth,I really hope my daughter turns out like you when she grows up.
3,31,Fred Booth,You all right?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you shut up!"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's been a weird day.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,You put the Peeps in the chili pot and eat them both up.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,You put the Peeps in the chili pot and add the M&M's.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"You put the Peeps in the chili pot, it makes it taste bad."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna eat all this chili and/or die trying.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Anyone want any?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'm just gonna put it right down here.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Come on.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Dip your paws in my chili.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Scoop your little mittens right in the stew.
3,31,Eeth Kurban,"Professor, I can see that you're going through something, but exams are next week."
3,31,Eeth Kurban,"So, can you teach us anything?"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"All right, nerd."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,You want to learn something?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'll teach you something.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,How do you like them apples?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, over the last 2,500 years, Western philosophers have formed three main theories on how to live an ethical life."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, first off, there's ""virtue ethics""."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and character, like courage or generosity, and you should try to develop yourself in accordance with those virtues."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,The gift will be anonymous.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Next, there's consequentialism."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,The basis for judgement about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,How much utility or good did it accomplish versus how much pain or bad.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"And finally, there's deontology."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,The school of thought that there are strict rules and duties that everyone must adhere to in a functioning society.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Being ethical is simply identifying and obeying those duties and following those rules.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"But here's the thing, my little chili babies, all three of those theories are hot, stinky cat dookie."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"The true meaning of life, the actual ethical system that you should all follow is nihilism."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,The world is empty.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,There is no point to anything and you're just gonna die.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"So, do whatever!"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"And now, I'm gonna eat my marshmallow candy chili in silence, and you all can jump up your own butts."
3,31,Mylie Kinogue,Is that gonna be on the test?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,And no.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,And you all get A's or F's.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"And there is no test, and you all failed it."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,And you all got A's.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Who cares?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Goodbye.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Goodbye.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool lecture.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,And cooler shirt.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,You feeling all right?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Feel fine.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,I do have a stomachache.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,Why do I always have a stomachache?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you just ate 50 pounds of chili, bro."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,This one's on you.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, I know the future seems bleak, but I have a plan."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come with me.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nah-uh-uh, leave that chili, weirdo."
3,31,Michael,A complete account of every single thing we've done and learned.
3,31,Janet,I added all the data we've gathered here on Earth in chart and graph form.
3,31,Janet,And I added a pretty tasty little recipe for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.
3,31,Michael,Ha!
3,31,Michael,"Maybe someone, some day, can learn from our mistakes and enact real change in the process of judging people."
3,31,Michael,"But for now, Janet, old friend, we are going to enjoy our time on Earth before we're retired."
3,31,Janet,Hmm.
3,31,Michael,"So, let's get started."
3,31,Michael,"I know it's touristy, but I'd really like to visit a LensCrafters."
3,31,Janet,Ooh!
3,31,Janet,And I'd like to get bangs.
3,31,Michael,"Hey, guys."
3,31,Michael,It's really nice to see you.
3,31,Michael,"Um, is everything okay?"
3,31,Michael,"I mean, other than, you know, everything?"
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,We've started to accept our fates.
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,It's all chili under the bridge.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Good, you're all here."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Big news, everyone."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,We got married!
3,31,Jason Mendoza,We got tacos!
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, oh yeah, yeah, we got married."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"And then after we got married, we got tacos!"
3,31,Janet,Wow!
3,31,Janet,"Wow, that's crazy!"
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, it's strictly platonic, of course."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,We only did it so I could legally give Jason half my money.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,We just popped over to the British Embassy and signed the papers.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's insane, but it's also, like, the 11th most insane thing to happen today, so who cares?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need everyone to focus up.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the four of us the six of us, really, are doomed."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Our fates are sealed.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I think we have one move left: we can try.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,Try what?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Try to do good.
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That stupid little voice in my head told me to do something good today, and it was so annoying, but it also made a dork and his very untalented daughter super happy."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Me trying, just a little bit, put some good out into the world."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The six of us are not getting into the Good Place, but there are still people in this world that we care about."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I say, we try and help them be good people, try and help them get in."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, why not try?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's better than not trying, right?"
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor."
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's try.
3,31,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm in.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"I'm in, too."
3,31,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna remember this day forever because of your dope speech.
3,31,Jason Mendoza,"And also because of the great tacos I had, and also because I got married, and I found out I was going to hell, and also I became a hundred-millionaire."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, we get it."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,We get it.
3,31,Michael,It goes without saying that we're in.
3,31,Michael,Let's say it anyway.
3,31,Janet,Okay.
3,31,Michael,We're in.
3,31,Janet,We're in.
3,31,Michael,We're in.
3,31,Michael,"All right, you go."
3,31,Janet,We're in.
3,31,Michael,We're in.
3,31,Michael,We're just so excited!
3,31,Janet,We're in!
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What do you say, bud?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,You wanna join the Soul Squad?
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,Try to save some souls?
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I'm in."
3,31,Chidi Anagonye,"But first, I have to go to the bathroom forever."
3,31,Larry Hemsworth,"There you are, my love."
3,31,Larry Hemsworth,"I was just on my way to the MRI lab, thought I heard your voice."
3,31,Larry Hemsworth,"Ready to go to the airport, start our lives together?"
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Go ahead, Tahani."
3,31,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're rolling.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay, okay."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's do sophomore year of high school.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, Nathan Burlingame."
3,32,Janet,Didn't like you.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huh.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kylie Mansard?
3,32,Janet,Thought you were cool but intimidating.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought she was intimidating.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's why I shoved her into that creek.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, after my chili episode, I asked the administration for a one-year sabbatical, and good news they fired me."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I am free and easy!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, the rest of the Soul Squad is off helping Jason's dad."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are we saving?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one from my high school.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I will tell you that much.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, before we do anything, I have to break things off with Simone."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"If I slip up and tell her about the universe, it could doom her for eternity."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"And I've avoided talking to her for so long, she assumed I had laryngitis and it went too far."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"And now, I'm on antibiotics."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, settle down."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Your moral code means you can't lie, right?"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,You need to just ghost her.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Disappear, block her number."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bonus, anything she left in your apartment now legally belongs to you."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've done that to dozens of people, and all of them got over it."
3,32,Janet,"Actually, none of your exes have ever gotten over you."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're damn right they didn't.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I just wish I could end things in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.
3,32,Janet,Bing!
3,32,Janet,"I usually appear out of thin air and there would be a pleasant ""bing"" sound, but I don't have my powers, so I'm doing my own bings now."
3,32,Janet,Bing!
3,32,Janet,"Chidi, what if I could create a virtual reality simulation where you could practice different breakup scenarios?"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,You can do that?
3,32,Janet,I think so.
3,32,Janet,"I do know everything about you, and Simone, and computer programming, and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence, and the human brain, and everything else!"
3,32,Janet,I'm kind of a nerd.
3,32,Janet,I'll start building the simulator now.
3,32,Janet,Bing!
3,32,Janet,Don't turn around.
3,32,Janet,It's embarrassing.
3,32,Janet,Bing!
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Jacksonville!
3,32,Jason Mendoza,What up?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Duval!
3,32,Floridians,Duval!
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Poor Larry.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But, ""If you love someone, set them free."""
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"A good friend and yoga pupil, Sting, no last initial, told me that."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I can't wait to show you guys all the cool sights in Jacksonville.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Like, that swamp is where me, Pillboi and Donkey Doug used to stand and try and blind pilots with laser pointers."
3,32,Michael,"Yeah, maybe we should do the tour after we, you know, save your father's soul."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I've been meaning to ask: why are you trying to save your father?"
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I've heard you mention your friend Pillboi many times, but you've not mentioned your father once."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,What do you mean?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sorry, the man you call ""Donkey Doug"" is your father?"
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Yeah!
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Donkey Doug with whom you tried to blind airline pilots with laser pointers?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Yeah!
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Donkey Doug who's banned from Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"In his defense, he thought it was someone else."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"So, Michael and I have a plan to save my dad."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"My whole life, Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble because of some get-rich-quick scheme."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,He sold counterfeit Truck Nutz.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,He created a sport that was a cross between dodgeball and horseshoes and everybody died.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,He glued --
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,This should be easy.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,We have plenty of money.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"If we just give him money, he'll blow it."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,He's gotta feel like he did it himself.
3,32,Michael,"A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close to getting his electrician's license."
3,32,Michael,"So, if we get him to finish the training, he can earn an honest living and be on his way to getting more Good Place points, which is why we're all here."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, let's go save my dad."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Taxi!
3,32,Porter,Do you need help with your bags?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"No, I got it."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Oh, dip, Jason!"
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Ah, dip, Donkey Doug!"
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You call him ""Donkey Doug"" in person?"
3,32,Donkey Doug,Me and Jason are cool like that.
3,32,Donkey Doug,I don't think of him as my son.
3,32,Donkey Doug,I think of him as my boy!
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, I am your boy."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Yeah, but it's more like, ""That's my son right there, son."""
3,32,Donkey Doug,"But not, like ""son-son"", but like ""my boy""."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"But not, like --"
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, yes, we get it."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, this is my friend, Michael."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Oh, crap, you look like a cop."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Are you a cop?
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Because if you are, you have to tell me, and you're not allowed to arrest me for anything you saw before I knew you were a cop."
3,32,Michael,I'm not a police officer.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Michael's cool.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"And this is Tahani, who is my wife, I guess."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Dang, nice pull, son!"
3,32,Donkey Doug,How about you and me go check out my Jacuzzi and put stuff in each other?
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Again, I'm his wife."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Wow.
3,32,Donkey Doug,That's the first time that line has ever failed.
3,32,Donkey Doug,You must really love him.
3,32,Donkey Doug,Welcome to the family!
3,32,Donkey Doug,Come on in!
3,32,Janet,"This program knows everything about your personality, Simone's personality and all human relationships."
3,32,Janet,"It can't tell you exactly what will happen, but it will approximate Simone's reaction to anything you say to her."
3,32,Janet,"Plus, it has Tetris!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Would this work with, say, me, and, say, Jason Statham, and, uh, instead of a cafe, it was, say, a room with a futon and a bunch of Red Bull?"
3,32,Janet,"Why is it that every time a new thing is invented, humans immediately try to use it for porn?"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because we're disgusting.
3,32,Janet,Huh.
3,32,Janet,Eleanor and I will be watching on the monitor.
3,32,Janet,We'll see what you see.
3,32,Janet,Put these in your ears.
3,32,Janet,They'll play a tone that will trick your brain into seeing what I've programmed.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, so, this is I'm here."
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Hey, babe!"
3,32,Simone Garnett,What do you want to talk about?
3,32,Janet,"Go ahead, Chidi."
3,32,Janet,Practice what you want to say to her.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Um Simone, this has been the best year of my life, because of you."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Unfortunately, I have come to learn some information, and it means that we have to end this relationship."
3,32,Simone Garnett,What information?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I can't say.
3,32,Simone Garnett,Why not?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I I can't say."
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Well, you've either gone crazy or you're too much of a coward to tell me how you feel."
3,32,Simone Garnett,Which is it?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"I I can't, because of Janet!"
3,32,Simone Garnett,Who's Janet?
3,32,Simone Garnett,And why are you screaming her name into the sky?
3,32,Simone Garnett,You know what?
3,32,Simone Garnett,Whatever.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Goodbye, Chidi."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, wait"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"So, that didn't go great."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I disagree.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought it was hilarious.
3,32,Michael,"So, Donkey Doug, Jason told us about your electrician license, and we have a career opportunity for you."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Yo, later for that."
3,32,Donkey Doug,I got a business proposition for you.
3,32,Donkey Doug,Pillboi!
3,32,Pillboi,"Oh, dip, Jason."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip, Pillboi."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Oh, dip, Pillboi."
3,32,Pillboi,"Oh, dip, Donkey Doug."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Oh, dip, Jason."
3,32,Michael,This is remarkable.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,It explains so much.
3,32,Pillboi,"Jason, I thought you were dead."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I was alive.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I was in Australia.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I talked to you on the phone last week.
3,32,Pillboi,"Yeah, but I forgot."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Oh.
3,32,Donkey Doug,Me and Pillboi have been cooking up something real special.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"And this time, it's not fake meth."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"All right, Pillboi, tell 'em about our new product."
3,32,Pillboi,"Sharks, how much do you spend on energy drinks and body spray in one week?"
3,32,Pillboi,Three hundred dollars?
3,32,Pillboi,Ten hundred dollars?
3,32,Pillboi,What if I told you there was a product that combined these two things for one solution to all of life's problems and more?
3,32,Pillboi,I give to you Double Trouble.
3,32,Pillboi,The world's first energy drink/body spray.
3,32,Michael,"So, uh, do you spray it on yourself or do you drink it?"
3,32,Pillboi,You both it!
3,32,Donkey Doug,"This is the one, Jason."
3,32,Donkey Doug,We're gonna be so rich!
3,32,Donkey Doug,I'll finally be able to pay to have my calf implants moved back up from my feet.
3,32,Michael,This is gonna be a lot tougher than we thought.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Tell me about it.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Double Trouble sounds amazing.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,We should bid fast.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,The other sharks are gonna want in.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I just have to be simple, honest and declarative, and somehow, still protect her feelings."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know, man."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe just tell her that you're gay.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not gay.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Fine, bi."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not bi either.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why not?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,More guys should be bi.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's 2018.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like, get over yourselves."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Is there any way I can try a bunch of different things in a row to see what works?
3,32,Janet,Bing!
3,32,Janet,Sure.
3,32,Janet,"If you want to reset, just snap your fingers."
3,32,Janet,"Also, I made some modifications to the tone, so it should make your transition easier."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Hey, babe."
3,32,Simone Garnett,What did you want to talk about?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I don't love you anymore."
3,32,Simone Garnett,What?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no, you don't understand."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't technically love you, in the same way, because of circumstances."
3,32,Simone Garnett,What?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Hang on.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm dying."
3,32,Simone Garnett,"No, you're not."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, I am."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Because we're all dying, slowly, when you think about it."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"We start dying the moment we're born, so, not a lie."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Here it is.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I'm just going to be perfectly honest.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"My real name is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Nope!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Simone, the last year has been truly amazing."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,And with that in mind will you marry me?
3,32,Simone Garnett,Yes!
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Yes, of course I will!"
3,32,Simone Garnett,Oh!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, what am I doing?"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Why did I think this would work?
3,32,Janet,"Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead and reboot this one myself."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, good call."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Simone"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, before you say anything, I think we should break up."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,You do?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I love and respect you very much, but we're heading in different directions."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And don't worry, we don't have to make a big thing of it."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, my God."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,This is the one.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Remember everything.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Right leg crossed over left, coffee's right there."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, one more thing."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Suck it, ya doink!"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"This is Eleanor, you idiot!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet let me mess with the simulator to screw with you!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Janet!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Come on!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Chidi, this is Janet now."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, it won't happen again."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Psych!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's still Eleanor.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I can't believe you fell for that, ya doink."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"We need to break up, but here's a puppy!"
3,32,Simone Garnett,Aw!
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Wait, what?"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"He's a puppy, it's over between us, and he's cute!"
3,32,Simone Garnett,Do you think I don't hear the bad parts of these sentences?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"His name is Martin, I need my keys back and he's a puppy!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are very bad at this.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, that's because I don't actually want to break up with her!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What, do you need me to break up with her for you, like we're in middle school or something?"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, please do that for me."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Please.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Hey, Eleanor!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
3,32,Simone Garnett,What did you want to talk about?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, first of all, you and Chidi are so great together."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,He really loves you and I can see why.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're brilliant, charming, obviously gorgeous"
3,32,Simone Garnett,Aw!
3,32,Simone Garnett,You're sweet to say that.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop, and your accent is so cute!
3,32,Simone Garnett,Your accent is so cute!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think I have an accent.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"""I don't think I have an accent!"""
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stop it!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is happening?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Nope!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,No!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,This is over.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, come on!"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was just getting good.
3,32,Michael,Let's remember the mission.
3,32,Michael,Your father needs to focus on long-term stability.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Also, and perhaps this is less important, but there's an awful lot of dog hair on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Not bad, right?"
3,32,Donkey Doug,Double Trouble comes in three delicious smell-flavors.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Raspberry-Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme."
3,32,Donkey Doug,That one is also a lube.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Look, Donkey Doug, Double Trouble is dope."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"On that much, we can all agree on."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,But you gotta think long-term.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,You were good at electricity stuff.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,You hooked us up with free porno channels every year ever since the third grade.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"It's good, honest work."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"""Honest work""?"
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Whatever, Dad."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're his dad.
3,32,Pillboi,"This is huge, J."
3,32,Pillboi,"When Double Trouble pops off, I'll be able to quit my job at the old folks' home."
3,32,Pillboi,Buy a big-ass mansion.
3,32,Pillboi,"Every day I'd wake up, get out of bed, brush my teeth, rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge, ""Damn, we outta milk"", get in my car --"
3,32,Michael,You don't have to run through the whole imaginary day.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Jason, I believe in Double Trouble."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Why won't you believe in me?
3,32,Michael,"Oh, boy"
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit never hurt anyone."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know, ""Reach for the stars"", as I said to my good friend Elon Musk."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,And then he shot his car into space.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,What a weird creep.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why was I friends with him?
3,32,Michael,Maybe this is what'll put your father on the right path.
3,32,Michael,"And, hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Yeah.
3,32,Donkey Doug,It's a factory!
3,32,Michael,Excuse me?
3,32,Pillboi,"Tonight, we're gonna steal some energy drinks from an energy drink factory, and steal some cologne from a cologne factory."
3,32,Pillboi,"So, it's actually two factories."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Then we just gotta bottle it all up!
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Aw, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Three factories.
3,32,Pillboi,Three factories!
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Stupid Donkey Doug.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, two factories I can understand, but three?"
3,32,Michael,You might want to consider the possibility that your father's a lost cause.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I have an idea, but I need your help."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Will you guys help me?
3,32,Michael,"I mean, yeah, that's that's why we're here, Jason."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"What's your idea, darling?"
3,32,Jason Mendoza,We're gonna save Pillboi.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, real life."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I think I'm ready.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I've analyzed the ten most successful scenarios and compiled the statistically most effective breakup strategy.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who said you weren't a romantic?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Every girlfriend I've ever had.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,There she is.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, wish me luck."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, hi."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
3,32,Simone Garnett,Something wrong?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, no."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,It's just that we're usually over there.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Doesn't matter.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that's happened in the last year --"
3,32,Jolivia Oowton-Nohn,"Hi, there."
3,32,Jolivia Oowton-Nohn,What can I get you to drink?
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Uh, I'll have an iced tea, please."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Water, thanks."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, it's been a time of massive personal and professional growth --"
3,32,Jolivia Oowton-Nohn,"Sorry, sugar with that iced tea?"
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Yes, please."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, all in all, it's been overwhelmingly positive, and I think that's due in large part to you."
3,32,Jolivia Oowton-Nohn,"Sorry, real quick, I'm gonna go on break, so Helmut will be taking care of you."
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,Hello!
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,Will you be eating with us today?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Just please give us one second!
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,"Ja, okay."
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,One!
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,That was one second.
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,That was joke!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Please get out of here, Helmut!"
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,"Okay, ja!"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"All right, look, just, um we need to break up!"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I am breaking up with you!
3,32,Simone Garnett,Why?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"I can't it's complicated, but it's happening."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Ya dumped!
3,32,Simone Garnett,Okay.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, wait, no."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Come back, please!"
3,32,Helmut Deutschermann,"Ja, okay, I'm back!"
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Not you, Helmut!"
3,32,Pillboi,"Hey, now, listen, Judy."
3,32,Pillboi,You cant mix Xannies with these lil' pink fools.
3,32,Pillboi,You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was when he crawled into the ice machine.
3,32,Pillboi,"Here, take half of one of these, wash it down with a 5-Hour Energy, and you'll be golden."
3,32,Pillboi,Body high with mild visuals.
3,32,Judy,"Thanks, Pillboi."
3,32,Pillboi,"Yo, I gotta take off 'cause I gotta go do a robbery."
3,32,Pillboi,"I mean, I'm sick."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, Pillboi."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm here on behalf of Jason.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,You won't be attending the job with Donkey Doug today.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,There's been a change of plans.
3,32,Pillboi,Okay.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's it?
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,You don't need any more information?
3,32,Pillboi,"I mean, do you want to tell me?"
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not really.
3,32,Pillboi,Cool.
3,32,Pillboi,Want some pills?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I hate this.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,What if I ruined her?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,What if I sent her down the wrong path and she ends up in the Bad Place?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I have to undo what I did.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Janet, fire up the simulator."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, no more simulations."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just talk to her.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,Breakups never end with both people feeling great.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But she's a badass, and her world is bigger than your relationship."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,She'll recover.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just go, be a person."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Here I go.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can I use the simulator?"
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz concert I want to be front row at.
3,32,Janet,Sure!
3,32,Janet,"FYI, when the system boots up, you might find yourself in a steam room with Jason, who will be wearing an old-timey strongman onesie."
3,32,Janet,It's a bug in the system.
3,32,Donkey Doug,Pillboi?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"No, it's me."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Pillboi's friend Jason.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Pillboi's not coming.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"If you're here to tell me an energy drink body spray is a bad idea, I've heard it before."
3,32,Donkey Doug,From a bank and some doctors.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I'mma help you make Double Trouble, but you gotta leave Pillboi alone from now on."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I'm trying to save him.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Oh, dip."
3,32,Donkey Doug,You got religious and shizz?
3,32,Donkey Doug,Amen.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Amen.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, hurry up and get this crap in my truck."
3,32,Police Officer,Jacksonville Police.
3,32,Police Officer,Come out with your hands up!
3,32,Donkey Doug,Are you a cop?
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Because if you are, you have to tell us!"
3,32,Police Officer,Yes.
3,32,Police Officer,This is the police.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Yup, I knew it."
3,32,Donkey Doug,It's the cops.
3,32,Donkey Doug,What do we do?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, let's get out of here."
3,32,Donkey Doug,No.
3,32,Donkey Doug,I know I haven't been the best father in the world.
3,32,Donkey Doug,I might not have even been in the top five.
3,32,Donkey Doug,I want to make up for that.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"I'll distract them, you run out the back."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"No, that's crazy."
3,32,Donkey Doug,It's what my dad did for me.
3,32,Donkey Doug,"And his dad, for him."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"And some day, you'll do this exact thing for your son."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, I hope not."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"But thanks, Donkey Doug."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Hey call me ""Donkey Dad""."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, Donkey Dad."
3,32,Donkey Doug,"Nah, that sounds wack."
3,32,Donkey Doug,Call me Donkey Doug.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
3,32,Donkey Doug,Bortles!
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Uh here's the truth.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,You're amazing.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,And my feelings have changed.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,I wish I could tell you why.
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"I really, really do."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,But I can't.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Well, you seem to know what you want, which is rare for you."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I uh I hope you keep the study going."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,It might help a lot of people.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"Well, see you in the next life."
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,Why would you say that?
3,32,Chidi Anagonye,What do you know?
3,32,Simone Garnett,It's a figure of speech.
3,32,Simone Garnett,"You're so weird, man."
3,32,Simone Garnett,I think maybe this is for the best.
3,32,Michael,"So, your covert mission is to continue to report to this job until you receive our signal."
3,32,Michael,"Now, this is the most important thing you cannot commit any more crimes, and you must help these people as much as you can."
3,32,Michael,The mission depends on it.
3,32,Pillboi,Roger that.
3,32,Pillboi,"Man, I can't believe this whole time you guys were with NASA."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, we are secret astronaut spies."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is indeed what Jason told you.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Take good care of these old fools and stay out of trouble.
3,32,Pillboi,"I love you, bro."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I love you, bro."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Psych!
3,32,Pillboi,"I got you, bro."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"I got you, bro."
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Jag
3,32,Pillboi, uars
3,32,Jason Mendoza, rule.
3,32,Pillboi, rule.
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, my sister's museum exhibit opens tomorrow."
3,32,Tahani Al-Jamil,Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil family reconciliation?
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"You know it, wifey!"
3,32,Jason Mendoza,Soul Squad is on a roll.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing.
3,32,Jason Mendoza,"And I got closure with my dad, Donkey Doug."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,That remains depressing.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I'm happy for you, bud."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I never got to do that with my parents, and now they're both dead, so it's impossible."
3,32,Janet,"So, the thing is, one of your parents is not technically actually dead."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you talking about?
3,32,Michael,Your mother's alive.
3,32,Michael,She faked her own death.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry, Tahani."
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't think I'll be able to stay with you here in Budapest.
3,32,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Turns out my mom isn't dead, so I need to fly back to America to murder her."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,So my mom is alive and she lives here.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why didn't you tell me sooner, man?"
3,33,Michael,"I'd already told you that you'd died, and that I had tortured you for centuries, and that you're doomed to be tortured again."
3,33,Michael,"I just didn't want to be, like, a bummer."
3,33,Michael,But now you know everything important about your life.
3,33,Michael,I promise.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,A police officer came to my home and told me that my mom had been accidentally trampled to death when she bent down to adjust her toe ring at a Rascal Flatts concert.
3,33,Michael,That police officer was an actor.
3,33,Michael,"See, about a month before, your mom had gotten drunk, wandered into a charity auction and bid $30,000 for a date with Gene Simmons, outbidding everyone else by $29,800."
3,33,Michael,She didn't wanna pay.
3,33,Michael,"So, she faked her death, moved to Nevada and reinvented herself as Diana Tremaine."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Diana Tremaine is my fake ID name!
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,How dare she steal the identity I stole.
3,33,Michael,"Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but we're here to help your mom get into the Good Place."
3,33,Michael,"Whatever you're feeling, remember, this is not about you."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,How could you do this to me?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Yay!
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,You found me!
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the hell, Mom?"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Okay, baby, I can explain everything."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Let's all just take a breath.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"You haven't even introduced me to this stretched out, sexy Alex Trebek."
3,33,Michael,I'm Michael.
3,33,Michael,"It's nice to meet you, Donna."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Oh, uh, it's Diana now, for, you know, police reasons."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"By the way, whose McMansion is this?"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"My boyfriend, Dave's."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"He's kind of a dork, but real sweet and so fancy."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"His napkins are made out of, like, shirt material."
3,33,Michael,Cloth.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, now this is making sense."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You change your name, bag a rich loser with a tacky house."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I get it.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're running a scam.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Baby, this is as real as the nails under my acrylic nails."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I'm a different person.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Spare me.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You will always be sun-baked Arizona trash.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I know that because I grew up baking right beside you.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Oh, geez, I didn't know we had company."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Hey.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Hi, I'm Dave."
3,33,Michael,Michael.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course you're Dave.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Dave?"
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and I need to have a little conversation.
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,Diana.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Oh, hey."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who the hell is this chick?
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"This is my little potato pie, Patricia."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"And who might you be, by the way?"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Eleanor is my sorority sister.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good old Kappa Zeta Jones.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Oh!
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Hey.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can't believe I have to wait in line to see my own sister.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I have never waited in any kind of formation, let alone a line."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Wow!
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Is this whole room just her work?
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Don't be fooled, Chidi."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamilah is a charlatan.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,All she has to do is paint some dumb shapes and people go mad.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,Those aren't dumb shapes.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,They're a pair of boobs.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,And then two extra sideboobs.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,It symbolizes that boobs come in all shapes and sizes and distances apart.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ugh!
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Maybe we should just go.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,There are plenty of other people I could help.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like my good friend Ben Affleck and his crippling addiction to back tattoos.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or my other good friend Matt Damon and his crippling addiction to my friend Ben Affleck.
3,33,Janet,It's important that you make amends.
3,33,Janet,Your competitive relationship with Kamilah is largely the reason that you didn't get into the Good Place.
3,33,Janet,Stands to reason that the same would be true for her.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fine.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,But the waiting is over.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excuse me.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excuse me.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excuse me.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Tahani.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Were you waiting in line to see me?
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,That's hilarious.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"As a frog stares up in awe at the treetops, so too does humanity gawk at the purity of a blinding truth."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Napkins and forks are in the back.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, making omelets is art now, is it?"
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"Not that I'd expect you to understand, but it's a commentary on the world's fascination with subservience, consumption, death and pedagogy."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Cheddar or Swiss?
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no, I don't want an omelet."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just came for a quick sisterly chat.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"My sister, Tahani, refuses to order an omelet."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"As a result, the exhibit is now over and will never be shown again."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,There will be no refunds.
3,33,Jozsef Mvszember,Typical Tahani!
3,33,Istvan MvsziEmber-Bartja,And after Kamilah saved her life?
3,33,Istvan MvsziEmber-Bartja,What treachery!
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Sisters.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Am I right?
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Hey, now."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,I just checked my Apple Watch and it's marg-o'-clock.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"So, Michael, what do you do?"
3,33,Michael,"Ah, well, uh, I'm an architect."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Get out of here.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Me, too."
3,33,Michael,Huh!
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Dave's real good.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,You should see the new Hooters on I-15.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,It looks classy.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Like a bank.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, how did you two loverats meet?"
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Oh, it's a fun story."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,I was working on this project tearing down a condemned bar called the Desert Rash.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"I went in to meet with the contractors and Diana is sitting at the bar, drinking a seven in Seven in seven."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Seven shots of Seagram's 7 in seven minutes.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's Diana's morning drink.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Oh, that's right."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,It was very early in the morning.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Well, this little spitfire finds out it's me who's closing down the bar."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Next thing I know, she's got a knife to my face."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,I would have been scared if she hadn't been the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Aww.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"One thing leads to another, and all of a sudden, we're playing tonsil tennis on a broken toilet in the alley out back."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cute.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,So how did you and Eleanor become friends?
3,33,Michael,Let's just say that we lived in the same neighborhood.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Ooh.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"What a fun way to say a normal thing, right?"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Well, I've gotta go get ready."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Today is PTA elections and I'm running for secretary.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"And she's a shoo-in, too."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Hey, Patty, we gotta get ready, okay?"
3,33,Michael,"I know we came here to set your mom on a better path, but I think she's doing pretty great."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Please.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's completely full of it.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am gonna find out what kind of scam Donna Shellstrop is running and I am gonna take her down.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right after I finish this awesome drink.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing."
3,33,Michael,Right?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,33,Michael,And I'm not even a tequila guy.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,"So, this is what a museum looks like."
3,33,Jason Mendoza,"If you look at this painting closely, you can really notice the interpretation."
3,33,Janet,"I know you're just being silly and effortlessly charming, but you actually just picked the most valuable painting in the entire museum."
3,33,Janet,"As of last year, that work was valued at $39.2 million."
3,33,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, snap!"
3,33,Jason Mendoza,I forgot you know everything.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,How much is that one worth?
3,33,Janet,That one is worth $13.7 million.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,That one's got a bunch of colors.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,That's gotta add some value.
3,33,Jason Mendoza,Can we do this for all the paintings?
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I've had a sort of revelation about the world."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I would like to take responsibility for my part in our fraught history.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"For whatever hurt I've caused you, I sincerely apologize."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Thank you.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,I do not accept your apology.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"Is that all, then?"
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well
3,33,Jozsef Mvszember,An egg on an egg!
3,33,Istvan MvsziEmber-Bartja,Genius!
3,33,Jozsef Mvszember,Kamilah has done it again!
3,33,Michael,Check out what Dave gave me.
3,33,Michael,Plans for a Subaru dealership/burlesque club he's designing in Reno.
3,33,Michael,"Man, Nevada's a mess."
3,33,Michael,What are you doing?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Searching for the telltale sign of a Donna Shellstrop scam.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A pile of cash hidden somewhere, so she can grab it and head out on the run."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When the time comes, she will rip this guy off and disappear like Keyser Soze, right after he admitted to groping all those people."
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,Why are you in my room?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, hey, girl."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's up?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,How old are you?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Three?
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,I'm nine.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know anything about kids.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, has Diana ever made you hide like a special treasure in any of your toys?"
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,"No, Diana's very nice to me."
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,She bought me most of these stuffed animals.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, wow."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Neat.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mind if I give him just a little surgery just to check?
3,33,Michael,"Okay, okay, okay, all right."
3,33,Michael,"Doc McStuffins, let's get you some fresh air."
3,33,Michael,So sorry.
3,33,Michael,She's a kid.
3,33,Michael,You can't disembowel her toys.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Fine, new plan."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You casually mention that you're rich and seduce Donna.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When she goes for you, it will prove that this whole thing is a sham."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,First things first.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you have a penis?
3,33,Michael,I will not seduce Donna.
3,33,Michael,"For one thing, I could never do that to my pal Dave."
3,33,Michael,It goes against the architects' code.
3,33,Michael,"Also, your mother seems happy here."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead in this suburban boredom factory.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's scamming them.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, believe me, don't believe me."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't care.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna prove it.
3,33,Michael,"Young lady, you will stop this nonsense, go to the PTA meeting, and support your mother."
3,33,Michael,I won't hear another word about it.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the hell was that?
3,33,Michael,"Well, I was going for the stern-but-caring-dad vibe."
3,33,Michael,No?
3,33,Michael,Didn't work?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, not even close."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, not in the ballpark."
3,33,Michael,"I was trying something, Eleanor."
3,33,Michael,Give me a break.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Until Kamilah accepts my apology, this open wound will hinder any progress she might make toward getting into the Good Place."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Also, I am going to strangle her, which will hinder any air from getting into her lungs."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Can I talk to her?
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe we should try a little third-party mediation.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, hi."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"""Chidi"" is an Igbo word that means ""God exists""."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,That's right.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, I don't know the etymology of your name, but"
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,All of your fears are now mine.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,What did she say?
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, I got distracted."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,She's amazing.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,All of my fears are hers now.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course they are.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Um
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I sincerely apologize to you, because I have matured into a fully-formed adult with empathy and self-awareness, but if you don't accept my apology, I will smash your stupid art exhibit into bits."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,More Tahani theatrics with zero follow-through?
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"You don't have it in you to do anything that bold, because I'm the one who got the boldness gene, and the good eyebrow gene."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,All my fears are mine again.
3,33,Michael,"Hey, Davey."
3,33,Michael,Can you believe the design of this room?
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Auditorium?
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,More like audi-bore-me-um.
3,33,Michael,Savage.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Hello.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I'm Diana Tremaine.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I never thought I'd run for PTA board.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"For most of my life, I preferred to crawl."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Pub crawl!
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"But now, I wanna make sure kids in this decommissioned military bombing test side turned suburban township get the best education Nevada has to offer."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's that?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Always double down on 11?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Also, there's a pretty great kid who goes to this school, and I wanna make this place great for her."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Stand up, sweetheart."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Well, it was the first Hooters ever made out of brick."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,It's sort of inspired by Monticello.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Mark."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Oh, no, it's Dave."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know your name.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm calling you a mark.
3,33,Michael,Easy.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I got news for you, dad bod."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The woman you know as Diana Tremaine is really Donna Shellstrop, my much older mother."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,She faked her death and changed her name.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's the deal."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"I already knew all that, Eleanor."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Your mother told me everything the first night we met.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,First night?
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Well, no."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Not the first night, actually."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,That was mostly sex.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Your mother is a very confident and selfish lover.
3,33,Michael,Yikes.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"No, it's perfect for me, 'cause I don't know what I want."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"But anyway, the next morning, she told me everything."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,And we're gonna tell Patricia once she's a little bit older.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"For now, everything is going great."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, you don't know my mom."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She used to put, like, 50 things in a shopping cart, then go to the ""12 items or less"" aisle, scream ""rat"" and run out the door without paying."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,She is a liar.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"Well, listen, she has been nothing but honest with me, and I like that she's got a wild streak."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Kinda gets my motor running.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"To tell you the truth, she's turning me into a bit of a bad boy."
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,"I mean, who am I?"
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Avril Lavigne?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I get it."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Coming clean was all part of the scam.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's brilliant because he thinks she's honest, so when she runs off with all his money, he'll never see it coming."
3,33,Michael,"Come on, Eleanor."
3,33,Michael,"I changed, you changed."
3,33,Michael,"Maybe she changed, too."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
3,33,Michael,"Why can't you accept that she might be living a good, honest life?"
3,33,Michael,That she's an attentive partner and a good mom?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because I wanted that mom.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks instead of just telling me to look for loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why does Patricia get that mom?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then that means she was always capable of change, but I just wasn't worth changing for."
3,33,Michael,"I know as your self-appointed father figure, I'm supposed to say something comforting here, but I'm kinda stumped."
3,33,Woman,"Okay, final tally."
3,33,Woman,Forty-three votes for Diana Tremaine twelve votes for Ilene Capshaw and one vote for Bofa Deez Nuts.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't look at me like that.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're not my real dad.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Congratulations, Madam Secretary."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"It's so crazy, right?"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I'm gonna need to get a calculator.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,And maybe a globe?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I don't really understand the job.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, I'm sorry that I didn't think this whole thing was real."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just never thought I'd see the day when you made a commitment to anything.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was wrong.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Thank you, baby."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,That means a lot.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me help you.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"No, no, no, not that one!"
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"No, sorry, sorry."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,This powder is only for my delicates.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't wash your bras.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew it!
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,My mother is a con artist!
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gotcha!
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife, I get to spend the rest of this life in a Hungarian prison for destruction of art."
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,That's fun.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Destruction of extremely derivative art.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Kamilah's work has been mediocre for years.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mother and Father are probably rolling over in their cryogenic chambers.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Really?
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,You don't think they would be proud of her for having a whole museum wing dedicated to her work?
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,My parents' standards were incredibly high and they were impossible to please.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Plus, they always pitted my sister and me against each other."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,The two of them were a unit and Kamilah and I
3,33,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Girls, we have a new challenge for you."
3,33,Manisha Al-Jamil,Each of you has four hours to complete a rendering of your favorite moment in French military history.
3,33,Waqas Al-Jamil,The winning painting shall be hung in our foyer during our party honoring Francois Mitterand.
3,33,Manisha Al-Jamil,The losing painting shall provide the kindling for the fire that rages in our hearth during that party.
3,33,Manisha Al-Jamil,Doesn't that sound wonderful?
3,33,Young Tahani,"Yes, Mother."
3,33,Young Tahani,It does.
3,33,Young Kamilah,Thank you for this opportunity.
3,33,Waqas Al-Jamil,Who will be the winning artist and who will fail?
3,33,Waqas Al-Jamil,Let's find out.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,These paintings they're us.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,You're the boobs?
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"Once Jason said it, that's all I can see."
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Here we go.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,What?
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"Tahani, what are you doing?"
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Stop it!
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I'm going to hug you, because I love you."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,And because you feel just as alone as I do.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I understand that you can't accept my apology because that would quench your creative thirst.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"They forced us to compete, and that competition has fueled your art for decades."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's so awful and I'm so sorry.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"They were wankers, weren't they?"
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ah!
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.
3,33,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"Let them go, please."
3,33,Jozsef Mvszember,She's letting them go!
3,33,Jozsef Mvszember,"Oh, how merciful is Kamilah!"
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Diana Tremaine, you little devil."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"New name, same game."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Fine.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Things have been going good with me and Dave.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"But sometimes, I sneak a little bit of cash out of his wallet and I hide it away, just in case everything blows up and I need to skip town."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Are you happy?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, no, I'm not happy, but I think you are."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're holding on to this exit strategy, telling yourself that you can bail at any time, but the truth is you love this suburban life."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I don't love it so much.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,I am not basic.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Ya basic!
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, Mom."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya basic.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,And that's okay.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let me ask you something.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are you wearing yoga pants?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Well, on Tuesday nights, I do restorative yoga with a bunch of moms from Patty's school."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,And what do you do after yoga?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,We split avocado egg rolls at The Cheesecake Factory.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,But we also drink.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you drink?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Chardonnay.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,With ice cubes.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"And after one glass, I get sleepy."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"So I usually switch to water, so I can drive home like a nerd!"
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, hey."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's okay.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's good.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're happy here.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But you need to commit to this, which means getting rid of that stash of escape money."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think you know what you have to do with it.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Send it to Gene Simmons?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Spend it on Patricia.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Set up a college fund.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Buy her a crib.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or a car.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I truly don't know anything about kids.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,But this is your chance to break the chain of Shellstrop mother-daughter crappiness.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have a do-over.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Use it.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"Oh, baby, it seems like you've turned into a really good person, and you clearly didn't get that from me."
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,"So, props to whoever helped you."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there more cash in your bra?
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,Always.
3,33,Donna Shellstrop,It's why I don't wash them.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,I still can't believe that police officer pulled you over just to tell you that you were driving perfectly.
3,33,Janet,Why not?
3,33,Janet,I was.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,There is an article in the paper about Kamilah's latest art installation.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,And look.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,"""A Fractured Inheritance by Kamilah Al-Jamil and Tahani Al-Jamil""."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Gosh.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's very big of her.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Though, she really should have named the piece The Buried Hatchet."
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't you think?
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Such a better title.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm going to call her and rub it in.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe don't.
3,33,Chidi Anagonye,For now.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
3,33,Tahani Al-Jamil,Smart.
3,33,Michael,"Good luck, buddy."
3,33,Michael,"Oh, I almost forgot."
3,33,Michael,I sketched you up a little something.
3,33,Michael,Some ideas there for your project.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Wow!
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,This is more than a few ideas.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,You solved the whole thing.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Columns and porticoes.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Uh-oh.
3,33,Dave Katterttrune,Looks like you forgot to include bathrooms.
3,33,Michael,Oops!
3,33,Michael,Just a little oversight.
3,33,Michael,I've certainly used a bathroom.
3,33,Michael,Just like anybody else.
3,33,Michael,"Love to sit on the the thing and just, you know, shoot one out."
3,33,Michael,"Eleanor, I'll be in the car."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It was really nice to meet you, Patricia."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've got a lot of people who care about you here.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,And good luck with the SATs.
3,33,Patricia Katterttrune,I'm nine.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whatever.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good luck in school.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,You get it.
3,33,Michael,The others are on their way back from Budapest.
3,33,Michael,We'll be picking 'em up in a few hours.
3,33,Michael,Be happy.
3,33,Michael,Your mom found a better path all on her own.
3,33,Michael,And you definitely helped Patricia.
3,33,Michael,Double happy ending.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just I'm a little sad.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm glad my mom has changed, but that doesn't fix all the damage she did to me."
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's face it.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's the reason I could never get close to anyone.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never even told a boyfriend I love him.
3,33,Michael,"Oh, crap."
3,33,Michael,Um you remember how I told you that you knew everything important about your life?
3,33,Michael,"Well, I wasn't thinking about your afterlife life."
3,33,Michael,"In one of the reboots, you and Chidi fell in love."
3,33,Michael,Deeply.
3,33,Michael,And you told him that you loved him and he told you that he loved you back.
3,33,Eleanor Shellstrop,We did what now?
3,33,Michael,"Do you wanna listen to a podcast, maybe?"
3,34,Michael,This library is depressing.
3,34,Michael,All they have in the poetry section is Jeff Foxworthy books.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, we needed some place deserted, and there is no place more deserted than a public library in Arizona."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, let's go, man."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,We only have a few hours before we have to pick the gang up from the airport.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fire up Janet's memory gizmo.
3,34,Michael,Flooding your brain with memories from the afterlife is dangerous.
3,34,Michael,"In one of the reboots, you and Chidi were in love."
3,34,Michael,Can't you just take my word for that?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, dude."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,My screwed-up relationship with my parents made me believe I could never really love anyone.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need to see it for myself.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Those are my memories.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I want them back.
3,34,Michael,"Okay, fine."
3,34,Michael,Have a seat.
3,34,Michael,"Luckily, before we shut the neighborhood down, Janet saved a complete record of all the reboots."
3,34,Michael,Put those in your ears.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's all that for?
3,34,Michael,You'll see.
3,34,Michael,"We're going to start with a simple, three-second memory."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why only three second --
3,34,Bambadjan,"Oh, hi, Eleanor."
3,34,Vicky,"Buongiorno, Eleanor."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Morning, Bambadjan."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Morning, Vicky."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Those two are such forking dweebs.
3,34,Michael,"As I told you, recalling afterlife memories here on Earth has some significant side effects."
3,34,Michael,You should be back to normal in about 20 minutes.
3,34,Michael,Ah!
3,34,Michael,Looking a little better.
3,34,Michael,Banana must have helped.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Before we go any further, I have one very important question."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did I look hot bald?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause I always kinda felt like I could pull it off.
3,34,Michael,I have no real ability to gauge physical attractiveness in humans.
3,34,Michael,But no.
3,34,Michael,You did not pull it off.
3,34,Michael,"Okay, that short clip should have rewired your brain like an inoculation."
3,34,Michael,So now I can show you the highlights.
3,34,Michael,Reboot 119.
3,34,Michael,I'm skipping all of the sleeping and chewing.
3,34,Michael,You guys are always either sleeping or chewing something.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"So, we are moving on to the subject of free will versus determinism."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,We are officially done with Nietzsche.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I'm gonna miss Nietzsche."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I spent a lot of time thinking I was better than everyone else.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,And he showed me why I was right.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Give me that reading list.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do we got?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A little Aristotle, little Descartes, little Tommy Quine-Quine."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I called St. Thomas Aquinas.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Three months of philosophy class and you're already
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What are you grinning at, weirdo?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're going to be late for the neighborhood meeting.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I gotta say, it seems like I was really nailing that philosophy class."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can you believe my high school voted me most likely to die young and unaccomplished?
3,34,Michael,You did die young and unaccomplished.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fair enough.
3,34,Michael,Put those back in.
3,34,Michael,"Ah, my favorite four residents."
3,34,Michael,Don't tell the others.
3,34,Michael,"Welcome to ""Pick a Pet"" day."
3,34,Michael,We have hundreds of beautiful animals for you to choose from.
3,34,Michael,"And when you do make your choice, your pet will bond to your soul forever."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fabulous.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,I haven't had a pet since Barbra Streisand gave me one of her cloned Siamese cats and it killed itself.
3,34,Michael,Ah.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm going to look at the mythical pets, darling."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Catch up when you're ready.
3,34,Michael,May I?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
3,34,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, we can get mythical animals!"
3,34,Jason Mendoza,Maybe I'll get a penguin.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Penguins are real.
3,34,Jason Mendoza,"That's the spirit, Eleanor."
3,34,Jason Mendoza,"They're real to me, too."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,This one looks just like the one I had when I was a little kid.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,He's so cute!
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,But is is this one a little cuter?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, this pup looks friskier, but this one looks a little sweeter maybe?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-oh.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's Chidi kryptonite.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,The choice between any two things.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Settle in, lizard."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is gonna be a while.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, what's a mirror centaur?"
3,34,Michael,Ah.
3,34,Michael,"A stunning creature, whose human half takes on the image of its companion."
3,34,Tahania,Greetings.
3,34,Tahania,I am Tahania.
3,34,Tahania,Goddess of beauty.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, my."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Should I take the cutest puppy or is that shallow?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,And is it even okay to separate them?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"Are they brother and sister, or perhaps married?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, they're heaven-puppies."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sure they're both incredible.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just choose one.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,You're right.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,The black one!
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"That was my first impulse, and that is the one I'll take!"
3,34,Janet,"I'm so sorry, Chidi."
3,34,Janet,Both puppies have been taken.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,I should've seen that coming.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"My indecision has once again cost me happiness, and I will now suffer the consequences."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,How many pets have gone unclaimed?
3,34,Janet,Three.
3,34,Janet,A 16-foot albino python.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-mmm.
3,34,Janet,"Something called a tarantula squid, and this owl."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tarantula squid!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tarantula squid!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tarantula squid!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tarantula squid!
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,I'll take the owl.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Check it out!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet made him a little cowboy hat!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Isn't that stupid?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hello?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Spencer doesn't like loud voices!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Eesh, what happened, man?"
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I was trying to teach him to play fetch, like I did with my puppy as a kid."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"But instead of retrieving the stick, he attacked my face with his razor-sharp talons."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Because it was my mistake to not pick a puppy fast enough.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"I made my bed, and now I'll bleed in it."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let me do that, dummy."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come here.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What if I talk to Michael for you?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That way you don't have to worry about feeling ungrateful, or whatever, and maybe you'll still get a puppy, instead of"
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Ow!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop, deep wounds.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,You'd do that?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's the least I can do, considering everything you've done for me."
3,34,Michael,"So you get it, right?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey!
3,34,Michael,What?
3,34,Michael,"You liked him, he liked you."
3,34,Michael,You did nice things for each other.
3,34,Michael,"Your lack of parental affection did not make you numb to love, blah, blah, blah."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Blah, blah, blah""?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you want me to see this?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you hiding?
3,34,Michael,Nothing.
3,34,Michael,"It's just, the rest is not interesting."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no, you're right."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Not that interesting""."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just watching myself fall in love for the first time in fake heaven.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What else is on?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I am going to put this back in my ear, and you are going to show me how thoughtful and caring I am, or I'm gonna rip off your demon head and shove it up whatever's where your butt should be."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Roll it!
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Aw!
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"A lizard was a perfect choice, Eleanor."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,You both have combination skin!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, this is a weird question to ask."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll just throw it out there.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I ride your centaur?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am afraid Tahania's quite particular about whom she allows to ride her.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I tried, and she gave me a withering stare."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You didn't have, like, a stable full of horses growing up?"
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, of course, but they just pulled our carriages, or performed in our horse ballets."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,They weren't so what's the word?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Judgmental.
3,34,Tahania,With whom can I speak about acquiring new shoes?
3,34,Tahania,"You can't expect me to walk around in these flats all day, like some common glue-factory hobo horse."
3,34,Michael,Eleanor?
3,34,Michael,You were looking for me?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, yeah!"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Chidi chose an owl because he froze up trying to decide between two puppies."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it possible for him to swap?
3,34,Michael,Of course.
3,34,Michael,This is the Good Place.
3,34,Michael,But he might want to hold off.
3,34,Michael,"Tonight, we're having a party where everyone gets to transform into their pets for a few minutes, as a treat!"
3,34,Michael,"Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can do whatever lizards do!"
3,34,Michael,"Tahani, would you host the party at your mansion?"
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course!
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'd love to.
3,34,Tahania,Is that what you're going to wear?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course not.
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is it unflattering?
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can change.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, can't find my lizard."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,He was just out there like one second ago.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,No big deal.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Janet can find it.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't risk it.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"These pets are supposed to, like, bond to our souls forever."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Michael finds out mine ran away, he could figure out I'm not the real Eleanor."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just, um, go without me."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And tell people that I'm hanging out with my lizard because we are so meshed together, or whatever."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Circle of life, crap like that."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,You sure?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Go enjoy flying.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll meet you there.
3,34,Jason Mendoza,"Come on, Blake."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lizard?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lizard!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where the fork are you?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lizard!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why didn't I name you?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no!"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry I shoved you, man."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've just been a little jumpy.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, you didn't happen to see my lizard in the lake, when you were thrashing around down there?"
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,No.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,It was cold and dark and scary.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,But don't worry.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,We'll find him.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael and Janet are busy transforming people anyway, so they didn't even notice you weren't there."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy crap.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're supposed to be flying right now.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,It's no big deal.
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,I just decided I'd rather be helping you.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Than soaring through the air like an owl?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's amazing.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're amazing.
3,34,Michael,"After that, you spent all your time together."
3,34,Michael,You studied philosophy together.
3,34,Michael,You even got Chidi hooked on popcorn shrimp.
3,34,Michael,"Eventually, you became suspicious of me, and escaped to Mindy St. Claire's house on a train."
3,34,Michael,That was the first time you actually said it out loud.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love you.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel."
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you, too."
3,34,Michael,That's the story.
3,34,Michael,You're capable of human love.
3,34,Michael,Congrats.
3,34,Michael,Can we go now?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did it end?
3,34,Michael,"Like it always did, with me rebooting you."
3,34,Michael,There's no need to --
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Show me, please."
3,34,Michael,"All right, let's get this over with."
3,34,Michael,"So, listen, guys --"
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"No, you listen!"
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"We just went to Mindy St. Claire's, and when she wasn't trying to trick us into having a threesome, she filled us in on everything that you've been up to here."
3,34,Michael,"Oh, yeah?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We know this is, like, the hundredth time you've tried to torture us, but this time it's different because we're in love."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,And love is stronger than anything you can throw at us.
3,34,Michael,"No, it's not."
3,34,Michael,Love is stronger than anything I can throw at you?
3,34,Michael,I could throw an elephant at you.
3,34,Michael,You think a thrown elephant wouldn't crush you because of love?
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,She was speaking metaphorically.
3,34,Michael,"Even metaphorically, it's lame."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's okay.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No matter what he does, we will find each other, and we will help each other because we're soul mates."
3,34,Michael,"There's no such thing as soul mates, you dingus."
3,34,Michael,I made it up.
3,34,Michael,I put clowns in your house because you hate them.
3,34,Michael,"I forced you to choose the lizard, and then I made that lizard run away."
3,34,Michael,I made it all up!
3,34,Michael,Don't you understand that?
3,34,Michael,That's why I didn't want to give you your memories back.
3,34,Michael,I didn't want you to see how cruel I used to be.
3,34,Michael,"Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts back then, I thought it made me look classy, but it's it's all embarrassing."
3,34,Michael,"But I'm different now, I promise."
3,34,Michael,"I'll swear on a Bible, like you humans do."
3,34,Michael,I could grab one right now.
3,34,Michael,It's the only book they have in the sex-ed section.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not mad at you.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't be mad at a demon for being evil.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm just sad because I thought, for a second, I could love someone."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But really, it was just you manipulating me into thinking I loved someone."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, I guess I was right."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm incapable of love.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Eh.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's no biggie.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do you wanna get burgers?
3,34,Michael,Hang on now.
3,34,Michael,How did you draw that conclusion?
3,34,Michael,You just watched yourself fall in love with Chidi.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I didn't."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I watched a puppeteer pull a bunch of strings to make us think we were in love.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You said it yourself, you made it all up."
3,34,Michael,"Okay, yes."
3,34,Michael,I put you and Chidi in close proximity because I needed you to drive each other crazy.
3,34,Michael,But I never intended for you to fall in love.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Once you made us bond, the romance was inevitable."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a basic reality-show playbook.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Put a bunch of attractive young people in stressful situations so they act like idiots and have sex with each other.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is all just determinism.
3,34,Michael,What?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Determinism is the theory that we have no control over our own actions."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everything we do happens because of some external force, which exists outside of our control."""
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi because some all-knowing demon, you, brought us together and scripted our lives."
3,34,Michael,That's ridiculous.
3,34,Michael,I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You kinda did.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You orchestrated the whole Pet Day thing, manipulated us into choosing specific animals, made my lizard run away, which led to Chidi coming to help me find it, which led to us kissing, which led to us falling in love."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,None of that was my choice.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everything in my life has been determined by my upbringing, my genetics or my environment, and everything in my afterlife was determined by you."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,There is no such thing as free will.
3,34,Scott Fupple,"We're closing up soon, guys."
3,34,Michael,Yeah.
3,34,Michael,Can we just have 15 minutes?
3,34,Michael,We're kind of in the middle of something.
3,34,Scott Fupple,I'd take off if I were you.
3,34,Scott Fupple,"The second we close, they use this place to shoot pornos."
3,34,Michael,Okay.
3,34,Laverne,Want something to drink?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe I do, maybe I don't."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But whatever I choose will be the result of millions of biological, genetic and societal factors that are entirely outside my control."
3,34,Michael,Iced tea.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, that sounds good."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'll have one, too."
3,34,Michael,Okay.
3,34,Michael,"You think you have no free will because I scripted everything that happened, right?"
3,34,Michael,All I have to do is prove that you made one choice that I couldn't anticipate.
3,34,Michael,Easy.
3,34,Michael,"Okay, here's a perfect example."
3,34,Michael,In the very first attempt --
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, dude, dude."
3,34,Michael,What?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yelling.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're you're yelling.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, so loudly."
3,34,Michael,Oh.
3,34,Michael,Sorry.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry.
3,34,Michael,Yeah.
3,34,Michael,Watch this.
3,34,Michael,It's from the very first attempt.
3,34,Michael,If anyone has any information
3,34,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy."
3,34,Michael, about any of this
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, easy."
3,34,Michael," I beg you, tell me."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I love you, man."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, the problem in the neighborhood is me."
3,34,Michael,You saw your friend in pain and you decided to sacrifice yourself to help him.
3,34,Michael,That wasn't me pulling a string or manipulating you.
3,34,Michael,"In fact, it was the last thing I wanted."
3,34,Michael,Ruined my whole plan.
3,34,Michael,Free will.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, dude."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,The only reason I cared enough about Chidi to do that was because you forced us together.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Made me feel bad for causing him pain.
3,34,Michael,"Okay, yeah"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,34,Michael," but, no, you were constantly doing stuff I couldn't anticipate."
3,34,Michael,"As a matter of fact, I complained to you once right to your face."
3,34,Michael,I think it was Reboot 444.
3,34,Michael,"Now, is Chidi trapped in the purple space bubble?"
3,34,Michael,Yes.
3,34,Michael,Is he in pain?
3,34,Michael,Almost certainly.
3,34,Michael,Will he ever get out?
3,34,Michael,No.
3,34,Michael,However
3,34,Michael,"Uh, yeah, wrong one."
3,34,Michael,Wrong one.
3,34,Michael,"I mean, that's worth watching, it's great, but not the one I was thinking."
3,34,Michael,"It's probably, uh, 445."
3,34,Michael,"You, in here."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where am I?
3,34,Michael,Hell.
3,34,Michael,You're in hell.
3,34,Michael,Can I ask you something?
3,34,Michael,Have I missed anything in that freaky little noodle of yours?
3,34,Michael,"See, I've studied everything about your life."
3,34,Michael,"I know your hopes, your fears, your psychology, your tendencies."
3,34,Michael,"I know all your private shames, like that you don't wash your feet in the shower, your first concert was Barenaked Ladies and you had frequent sex dreams about Sam the Eagle from the Muppets."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, he's very authoritative and I find that reassuring."
3,34,Michael,You keep making crazy choices I don't understand.
3,34,Michael,Am I missing something?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm sorry, can we rewind for a second?"
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who are you?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who is that guy?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Am I dead?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is Sam the Eagle here?
3,34,Michael,No.
3,34,Michael,I tried to script your whole afterlife.
3,34,Michael,And I devised a 15-million-point plan to torture you.
3,34,Michael,You made choices I never saw coming.
3,34,Michael,I call that free will.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What if all your choices are predetermined?
3,34,Michael,You've gotta be kidding me.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't know.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe there's a megademon who built a torture chamber for demons, and this whole thing is just him torturing you."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And maybe all the megademons are just fulfilling a destiny laid out by a bunch of super-intelligent tarantula squids, who are torturing them."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why did you do that?
3,34,Michael,Because I have free will.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
3,34,Michael,And because you're being so annoying.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thank you.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,So sorry that he did that.
3,34,Laverne,Happens all the time.
3,34,Laverne,"Usually, it's the younger woman doing it to the older guy, though."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, not cool!"
3,34,Michael,Disagree.
3,34,Michael,I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done.
3,34,Michael,Do you really not see what's happening here?
3,34,Michael,Do you want me to spell it out for you?
3,34,Michael,"This is a defense mechanism, Eleanor."
3,34,Michael,You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi and it freaked you out to see yourself be so vulnerable.
3,34,Michael,"So, you're using determinism to convince yourself that those feelings were not real."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, you don't know me, man!"
3,34,Michael,"Yes, I do."
3,34,Michael,I know everything about you.
3,34,Michael,Remember?
3,34,Michael,Including that nothing scares you more than vulnerability.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, whatever."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who even cares?
3,34,Michael,I do.
3,34,Michael,"Because if everything is determined and we have no free will, then all this stuff we're doing to put more good into the world is pointless."
3,34,Michael,And I want to believe that it matters.
3,34,Michael,"So, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna use my free will right now to go pick up our friends at the airport."
3,34,Michael,"Worst possible use of free will, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because I care about them."
3,34,Laverne,"You might want to head out, too."
3,34,Laverne,"We're closing soon, and second we do, they use this place to shoot porn."
3,34,Jason Mendoza,First class was amazing!
3,34,Jason Mendoza,"They give you so many free presents: a shaving kit, an eye mask, a vest."
3,34,Tahani Al-Jamil,"At times like this, it's fun to remember that we're legally married."
3,34,Janet,That is fun.
3,34,Jason Mendoza,I call window seat!
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You were right.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was scared about what it all meant and I went back to one of my favorite moves: turn on the ol' blame hose.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""This is all your fault!"""
3,34,Michael,Apology accepted.
3,34,Michael,And I'm sorry I dumped iced tea on your head.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You kidding me?
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You did exactly what you should do when your friend is being annoying.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,You snapped me out of it.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's what made me realize, in a weird way, we're the only truly free beings in the universe because we actually know what's up with the afterlife."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think that means we need to be bold.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Take the Soul Squad to the next level somehow.
3,34,Michael,You're right.
3,34,Michael,"We need to find someone who can serve as a blueprint for humanity, someone whose life is so great that we can use it as a model to get as many points for as many people as possible."
3,34,Michael,And I think I know the perfect person.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Rihanna.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good call.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know her personally, but I did see her in Vegas once, and her calf brushed up against my tongue."
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I licked her leg.
3,34,Eleanor Shellstrop,I was kicked out.
3,34,Michael,It's not Rihanna.
3,34,Michael,It's someone way cooler.
3,34,Michael,"Hey, everybody out of the car."
3,34,Michael,Grab your bags.
3,34,Michael,We're going to rural Canada!
3,34,Shawn,Is it ready?
3,34,Glenn,I guess.
3,34,Glenn,We have no idea if it'll work.
3,34,Val,"Oh, I'm sure it's perfect."
3,34,Val,"Give it a try, Shawn."
3,34,Shawn,Me?
3,34,Shawn,I'm not going through that thing.
3,34,Shawn,She is.
3,34,Vicky, ask Michael how many times he rebooted them!
3,34,Vicky,He's lying
3,34,Shawn,"Yeah, zip it, toots, we're way past that."
3,34,Vicky,Where am I?
3,34,Vicky,How long was I in there?
3,34,Shawn,You have missed a lot.
3,34,Shawn,"Now, go through that makeshift portal."
3,34,Shawn,See if you explode.
3,34,Val,This might be gross!
3,34,Vicky,Am I on Earth?
3,34,Vicky,Did you figure out a way to build an illegal door to Earth?
3,34,Shawn,Yes.
3,34,Shawn,That's exactly what I did.
3,34,Glenn,"Well, we all helped."
3,34,Shawn,"Shut up, Glenn."
3,35,Michael,Hello.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Hello.
3,35,Michael,Hope we have the right house.
3,35,Michael,I'm looking for a Doug Forcett.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Well, I'm Doug Forcett."
3,35,Michael,Wow.
3,35,Michael,"Oh, yes."
3,35,Michael,"Yes, you are."
3,35,Michael,Sorry.
3,35,Michael,"Um, I'm a reporter for the Calgary Times Examiner."
3,35,Michael,"My name is, uh, Michael Scoop."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Mmm-hmm.
3,35,Michael,"This is my photographer, Janet Scoop."
3,35,Michael,She's my sister.
3,35,Michael,We're the Scoops.
3,35,Janet,"Oh, boy."
3,35,Michael,Some people in town are saying you live a pretty interesting life out here.
3,35,Michael,"Growing your own food, completely off the grid."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Mmm.
3,35,Michael,We would love to do a human interest story about you for the paper.
3,35,Michael,What do you say?
3,35,Doug Forcett,Oh.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Okay, let me think."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Well, first off, I'm so flattered that you'd wanna do a whole news story just about me."
3,35,Doug Forcett,That's so nice.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Heartfelt thanks to the whole Scoop family.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Can I ask, is your newspaper printed on recycled paper?"
3,35,Michael,"Yes, you know, very recycled."
3,35,Michael,The most.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"All right, then."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Come on in.
3,35,Michael,Great.
3,35,Michael,Great.
3,35,Michael,"Oh, hey, you know, before we forget, can Janet take a photo of you for the paper?"
3,35,Doug Forcett,Ooh!
3,35,Michael,"Okay, can you look up a little and to the right?"
3,35,Michael,"Smile, but only with your mouth and not your eyes."
3,35,Michael,Perfect.
3,35,Doug Forcett,It was 1972.
3,35,Doug Forcett,My friend Randy and I ate some magic mushrooms.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Randy asked me, ""What do you think happens when you die?"""
3,35,Doug Forcett,And I saw with perfect clarity how the afterlife works.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Immediately, I knew I had to live a perfect life."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Well, not immediately."
3,35,Doug Forcett,The next day all I could do was watch kung fu movies and stroke a blanket that I thought was my cat.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"But soon after, I designed a life that would maximize my point total, and help me get into the Good Place."
3,35,Doug Forcett,And I've been living it ever since.
3,35,Janet,Hmm.
3,35,Doug Forcett,I know this sounds crazy.
3,35,Michael,No!
3,35,Michael,"No, actually, it makes perfect sense."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Oh.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, boy."
3,35,Doug Forcett,You've been sitting here for ten minutes and I haven't offered you anything to eat or drink.
3,35,Michael,Oh!
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Would you like some water, or fresh radishes?"
3,35,Michael,Water'd be great.
3,35,Michael,Janet!
3,35,Michael,How cool is he?
3,35,Janet,Oh!
3,35,Michael,"You know, for a celebrity, he's amazingly down-to-earth."
3,35,Michael,"Stars, they really are just like us."
3,35,Janet,He's so thoughtful with his actions.
3,35,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
3,35,Janet,Thank goodness he had that hallucination.
3,35,Janet,He could've had the one Randy had where everything was made of ears.
3,35,Janet,Way less helpful.
3,35,Michael,"We have to learn everything we can about what makes him tick, so we can use it to help others."
3,35,Michael,"He is the blueprint, Janet."
3,35,Michael,He figured it all out.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Here we go.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Two waters.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Let me know if you're not happy with them.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I have ice cubes if it's too warm, and a Koozie if it's too cold."
3,35,Michael,Oh!
3,35,Michael,"Boy, that has an interesting aftertaste."
3,35,Michael,Is that from a nearby river?
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, no."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Why take fresh water away from the beavers and the fish?
3,35,Doug Forcett,"No, I have my composting toilet hooked up to a water filtration system."
3,35,Doug Forcett,One man's waste is another man's water and both men are me!
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,I'm pretty excited to relax and have a drink.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, saving souls feels great, but Sydney to Budapest, to Phoenix, to Calgary I'm so jetlagged I can't even regrender my chorf."
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,Don't even know what I was trying to say.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,You need to get your blood flowing.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,There's a pool table over there.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Wanna play?
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, sure, why not?"
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,Let's do it.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, can I ask your advice about something?"
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is it about your grating speaking voice?
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm so glad you finally brought it up.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Because honestly, with a few elocution lessons --"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I wanna ask you about Chidi."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong with my voice?
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Nothing!
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's lovely!
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Tell me about Chidi.
3,35,Janet,"So, it must get lonely up here all by yourself without anyone to talk to."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, I've got lots of friends."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"There's this little guy, for example."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Yeah, it's a snail."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Hi, snail."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I don't name them, in case they already have a name they prefer."
3,35,Janet,Huh!
3,35,Michael,"So, this is an organic garden."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Yeah.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Everything I eat, I grow myself."
3,35,Doug Forcett,The radish patch was actually here when I moved in.
3,35,Doug Forcett,I thought it'd be mean to dig it up.
3,35,Janet,Mean to the radishes?
3,35,Doug Forcett,Mmm.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I also grow lentils, because they require very little water."
3,35,Doug Forcett,And have the smallest carbon footprint.
3,35,Janet,Huh.
3,35,Janet,All he consumes are lentils and radishes.
3,35,Michael,"No, Janet, he also consumes his own waste."
3,35,Michael,"So, everything's fine."
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,How do you play pool again?
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,What are the rules?
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"That's one of the best things about pool, dawg."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,There are no rules.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,I am 100% sure there are.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Me and my friends play a special Jacksonville style of pool.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"It's called ""special Jacksonville-style pool""."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"You hit whatever ball you want, but you use your hands."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,And that's it.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, your turn."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"I got 1,000 points."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Oh!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,That's the other rule.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,You make up your own points.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,I got 5 million points?
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Damn!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,How'd you get so good at this so fast?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, in this whole other timeline, Chidi and I said ""I love you"" to each other."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,But he doesn't remember any of that happened.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, I guess my question is, when is the right time to tell someone you were passionate lovers in an alternate timeline in the afterlife, but he doesn't remember, because technically none of that happened in this strand of the multiverse?"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll just check with Yahoo Answers.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sure someone's weighed in.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, no, I'm flattered that you would seek my advice."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Though, I suppose it makes sense."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sure the one constant in all the reboots is that you and I were best friends.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh-huh.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Look, I don't think you would want Chidi to know what happened in the past unless you wanted it to happen again in the present."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,You can't know how Chidi will react.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It may be painful, but it's never a bad idea to tell someone how you feel."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, Tahani."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,You give really good advice.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you made a really hot centaur.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Sorry?
3,35,Doug Forcett,"So, these are some of my 71 adopted dogs and wolves."
3,35,Janet,You rescued every stray animal that's ever wandered on to your property?
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, yes, ma'am."
3,35,Doug Forcett,I've been mauled several times.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"This little guy here might look innocent, but, boy, he goes right for the squeaker, if you know what I mean."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Oh!
3,35,Doug Forcett,This is fun.
3,35,Doug Forcett,You get to meet Raymond.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Hi, Raymond."
3,35,Raymond,"Hi, dum-dum, who are these two hosers?"
3,35,Doug Forcett,Don't worry about Raymond.
3,35,Doug Forcett,He's just a local sociopath who comes by my house to take advantage of me.
3,35,Doug Forcett,I got your laundry all folded and ready for you.
3,35,Raymond,"For whatever reason, this loser does whatever you tell him to do."
3,35,Raymond,Watch.
3,35,Raymond,"Hey, give that guy your shoe."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Would that make you happy?
3,35,Raymond,Very happy.
3,35,Raymond,"Now, give him your shoe."
3,35,Michael,"No, that's okay, Doug, I don't need your shoe."
3,35,Michael,Please don't give me your shoe.
3,35,Raymond,"Well, then give me your shoe, or I'll be sad."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Here you are.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Well, as long as he's happy."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"See, if I make him happy, I get the points."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"That's how the system works, remember?"
3,35,Raymond,"Go get your shoe, idiot!"
3,35,Doug Forcett,Be right back.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Ah!
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, that's a bleeder!"
3,35,Janet,Oh.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Yeah.
3,35,Janet,"Michael, face facts."
3,35,Janet,Doug is not the blueprint of how to live a good life.
3,35,Janet,He's become a happiness pump.
3,35,Michael,What?
3,35,Janet,Remember from Chidi's lessons?
3,35,Michael,"I remember the term ""happiness pump""."
3,35,Michael,That's just mostly because Eleanor and Jason made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.
3,35,Janet,It's a criticism of utilitarianism.
3,35,Janet,A happiness pump is someone who is obsessed with maximizing the overall good at his or her expense.
3,35,Janet,Doug will do literally anything to make other people happy even if it makes him miserable.
3,35,Michael,"Oh, I don't think he's miserable."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"So, everyone happy and contented in here?"
3,35,Michael,What's
3,35,Doug Forcett,Oh.
3,35,Doug Forcett,I volunteer to test cosmetics for a local company so they don't have to test on animals.
3,35,Doug Forcett,It's fun for the animals who don't have to do it.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Uh, what can I do for you now?"
3,35,Doug Forcett,Would you like to move in permanently?
3,35,Doug Forcett,Or would either of you like any more water or one of my kidneys?
3,35,Michael,"You know what, we have absolutely everything we need, thank you."
3,35,Michael,We're gonna head out now.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Okay.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Well, it was so nice to meet you, Janet, and you, Mark."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I mean, Michael."
3,35,Doug Forcett,I called you Mark.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Your name is Michael.
3,35,Michael,"No, that's okay."
3,35,Michael,"Hey, stay with me here, buddy."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"No, no, no."
3,35,Doug Forcett,This is very bad.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Forgetting someone's name, that's definitely lost me some points."
3,35,Michael,"Hey, you know, I always secretly wished my name was Mark."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Lie!
3,35,Doug Forcett,That's a lie!
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Now, I'm accusing you of lying, and now I'm yelling."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Why am I yelling?
3,35,Doug Forcett,I need to make this up.
3,35,Doug Forcett,I'm gonna give you a really nice haircut.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Was that
3,35,Michael,A snail?
3,35,Michael,"Yeah, that was a snail."
3,35,Michael,Ooh.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
3,35,Doug Forcett,I think he's still alive.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Do either of you know anything about snail first-aid?
3,35,Michael,No.
3,35,Janet,Yes.
3,35,Janet,"I mean, no."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"All right, Michael, I need you to find some Scotch tape while I apply pressure."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Too much pressure!
3,35,Doug Forcett,I'm gonna need that tape!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Oh!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,What?
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Jacksonville style, baby!"
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,Thirty million points.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Nice one, homie!"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, what are you guys doing?"
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I either know exactly what I'm doing and it's something, or we're doing nothing and I'm winning."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Congrats.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Um can I talk to you for a second?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, uh, a few days ago, Michael showed me something."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I don't know exactly how to say this, but you and I are Bambadjan."
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, I never thought about it before, but yeah, we are kind of ""Bambadjan""."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you jetlagged doof!"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bambadjan is the name of a demon from the Bad Place who is somehow right over there.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come with me.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right now.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys, having fun?"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cool, cool, cool."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we need to get out of here immediately, because this bar is full of demons."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, just because these people are wearing cheap leather and stone-washed denim."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,They're still part of the queen's realm.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Calling them demons is a bit much.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, no, actual demons."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, from the Bad Place."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Chidi and I are gonna go out the side door."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and Tahani go out the back.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Or we do this the old-fashioned way.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,How did you make that so fast?
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Bortle --
3,35,Shawn,"Hello, idiots."
3,35,Shawn,Surprised to see me?
3,35,Shawn,Right.
3,35,Shawn,You don't remember.
3,35,Shawn,I'm Shawn.
3,35,Shawn,You are very scared of me.
3,35,Shawn,"Now, where's Michael?"
3,35,Doug Forcett,"We are here to celebrate the life of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore, the snail."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I named him/her that posthumously, because I imagine him/her to be the greatest and most talented snail ever to have lived."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Michael, would you care to say a few words?"
3,35,Michael,Oh.
3,35,Michael,You're serious.
3,35,Michael,"Yes, uh, okay."
3,35,Michael,Martin was a lot of things.
3,35,Michael,"A snail, mostly, but also a friend."
3,35,Janet,Mmm.
3,35,Michael,"Martin taught us about life, about love, and about the limits of Scotch tape."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Goodbye, Martin."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Happy slimy trails, old friend."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I'm sorry, I've gotta leave right away."
3,35,Doug Forcett,I've decided to make a donation to the Canadian Mollusk Association in Martin's honor.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Their office is in Edmonton, so it will take me about three weeks to walk there and back."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Take care.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Look out, little fellas."
3,35,Doug Forcett,Heads up.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Here comes a shoe.
3,35,Michael,"Say, Doug, look, do you mind if we ask you just a few more questions?"
3,35,Michael,"What you're doing here, how you're living your life, is just so wonderful."
3,35,Janet,Mmm.
3,35,Michael,But can I maybe give you just a little advice?
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I know, I should donate more blood."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"I'll try, but the last time I went down there, they said I was so anemic, they ended up giving me blood."
3,35,Michael,"No, look, look, um I've been a reporter for a long time, Doug."
3,35,Michael,Met all sorts of people.
3,35,Michael,"Traveled all over this crazy blue marble, meeting regular folks."
3,35,Michael,"Every face tells a story, Doug."
3,35,Michael,"Why, I'd say that those so-called regular folks often turn out to be not so regular after all."
3,35,Janet,Michael.
3,35,Michael,"Sorry, the point is, I have never met anyone so dedicated to making other people and snails happy."
3,35,Michael,"If what you're saying is true about the afterlife, then you must have earned more than enough points by now."
3,35,Michael,"So, loosen up, bud."
3,35,Michael,"You know, have a little fun."
3,35,Michael,Eat something besides lentils.
3,35,Doug Forcett,Like radishes?
3,35,Michael,No!
3,35,Michael,"No, Doug."
3,35,Michael,Damn it.
3,35,Michael,Just have ice cream or chicken parm.
3,35,Michael,Live your life!
3,35,Michael,Travel!
3,35,Michael,Drink regular water that wasn't inside you.
3,35,Michael,Okay?
3,35,Michael,Just relax.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Thank you, Michael."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"But, no."
3,35,Doug Forcett,I can't do any of those things.
3,35,Michael,Why not?
3,35,Doug Forcett,Because I can't risk it.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"There's an accountant out there somewhere, measuring the value of everything I do."
3,35,Doug Forcett,"What if I relax and do something that loses me just enough points to keep me out of the Good Place, and I'm tortured for eternity?"
3,35,Doug Forcett,"No, I have to make every moment count."
3,35,Doug Forcett,It's the only rational way to live.
3,35,Doug Forcett,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna walk to Edmonton to give $85 to a snail charity."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why don't you just take us to the Bad Place already, dude?"
3,35,Shawn,Because I want to see the look on Michael's face when he realizes he failed.
3,35,Shawn,I love seeing the look on people's faces.
3,35,Shawn,It's the best part of my job.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, Michael's not coming here."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Face it, man, you are outmatched."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Because Michael and Janet are brilliant and savvy.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,And they've been ten steps ahead of you this whole time.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We could sit here as long as you want, but you will never, ever, ever see Michael or Janet again --"
3,35,Michael,"Yikes, that was rough!"
3,35,Michael,Total bust!
3,35,Michael,Ah!
3,35,Michael,"Doug is a complete disaster, and I drank his piss."
3,35,Shawn,"Hello, Michael."
3,35,Shawn,See?
3,35,Shawn,See the look on his face?
3,35,Shawn,So great.
3,35,Michael,"Hello, Shawn, other demons."
3,35,Michael,What are you all doing down here?
3,35,Shawn,"What do you think we're doing, you hemorrhoid?"
3,35,Shawn,We're ending this charade once and for all.
3,35,Shawn,These four humans are the legal property of the Bad Place.
3,35,Shawn,That's where we're taking them and you.
3,35,Michael,"If you want them, you're gonna have to go through me."
3,35,Shawn,That's the idea.
3,35,Michael,"Well, it's a bad idea."
3,35,Shawn,"Oh, Michael, when will you ever learn?"
3,35,Janet,Screw this!
3,35,Janet,Let's fight!
3,35,Janet,"Get somewhere safe, you guys."
3,35,Chris Baker,Bad news.
3,35,Chris Baker,I've been going to the gym.
3,35,Chris Baker,A lot.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no!"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi!
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,What is happening?
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Ow, ow!"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let him go!
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,No!
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let him go!
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let him go!
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,Twelve years of fencing.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,En garde!
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Obviously, I'd never do that in a competition."
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,That'd be a three-tenths deduction.
3,35,Michael,No!
3,35,Michael,No!
3,35,Michael,Watch out!
3,35,Val,I've never marbleized a Janet before.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Jacksonville style, baby!"
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"2,000 points!"
3,35,Janet,"Thanks, Jason."
3,35,Michael,"Janet, door!"
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Three hundred points!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Best score ever!
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it just me or is Janet a straight-up hottie right now?
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,How are you this close to being dragged to hell and still horny?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,And how did you know they were demons?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ugh, I can't tell you that now!"
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Screw it.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,What am I waiting for?
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,We could die in the next 30 seconds.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Michael showed me a memory of our time in the Good Place, and you and I were, like, a thing."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,And --
3,35,Vicky,Gotcha!
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not like a casual, ""Hey, I found two loose pills in the bottom of my tote, let's pop 'em and see what's good"", kind of thing."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,We were in love.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,And there's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Here.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,On this plane of existence.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Today.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,In Canada.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,During this brawl.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,With demons.
3,35,Demon,Let's get her to the door.
3,35,Janet,No!
3,35,Janet,"Oh, cool!"
3,35,Janet,"When I'm even partway through the door to the afterlife, my powers come back."
3,35,Bambadjan,They do?
3,35,Janet,They do.
3,35,Janet,Thanks for asking.
3,35,Shawn,You're coming with me.
3,35,Janet,"Hi, there."
3,35,Michael,We did it!
3,35,Michael,What?
3,35,Michael,"No, yeah."
3,35,Michael,"No, of course."
3,35,Michael,Janet did it.
3,35,Michael,"Yes, but I had the, uh thank you, Janet."
3,35,Michael,How did you get down here?
3,35,Michael,We have the only key to the door to Earth.
3,35,Shawn,We built our own door.
3,35,Michael,That's impossible.
3,35,Shawn,"""That's impossible."""
3,35,Shawn,"Ugh, you're such a dweeb."
3,35,Michael,Why can't you leave us alone?
3,35,Michael,You don't have enough nostrils to stuff with wasps?
3,35,Shawn,"I don't want just any wasp nostrils, I want these wasp nostrils."
3,35,Shawn,"You're just delaying the inevitable, Michael."
3,35,Shawn,The Bad Place is going to get all of them eventually.
3,35,Shawn,"These four, their loved ones, even your precious pee-pee-king, Doug Forcett."
3,35,Michael,"Now, why would you think that?"
3,35,Shawn,Just a hunch.
3,35,Shawn,And do you wanna know what else I had a hunch about?
3,35,Michael,No.
3,35,Michael,"I mean, why let the guy keep saying mean stuff, right?"
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,I thought Doug Forcett was the blueprint for leading a good life.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,He seems pretty confident that Doug is heading to the Bad Place.
3,35,Michael,"For a while now, I have felt like there was something wrong with how the points system was evaluating humans."
3,35,Michael,"At first, I thought it was that the system didn't allow for the possibility that people could improve."
3,35,Michael,That's why I convinced the Judge to send you back to Earth.
3,35,Michael,So you could confront the ways you were living.
3,35,Michael,"But, now, I'm worried that the problems with the system might be much more serious."
3,35,Michael,We need to gather some real evidence.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Uh sorry no, no."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Michael, you're confused."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"It's a bad thing that you have to destroy, or you go to jail."
3,35,Michael,"Jason, quick, I need that coaster."
3,35,Michael,"Over there, behind the pillar."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"You got it, boss."
3,35,Michael,I just needed a 30-second break.
3,35,Tahani Al-Jamil,"What sort of evidence is this, and how do we get it?"
3,35,Michael,Janet and I have to go right to the source of the points themselves.
3,35,Michael,The Accountant's office.
3,35,Michael,"The four of you stay here, at Doug Forcett's house, until I get back."
3,35,Michael,You're gonna need to feed all the dogs and the wolves.
3,35,Michael,"And if a teenager shows up on a dirt bike, just do as he says."
3,35,Michael,He's very scary.
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Michael!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,Michael!
3,35,Jason Mendoza,I forgot what you asked me to get.
3,35,Michael,"That's okay, bud."
3,35,Michael,"Thanks, anyway."
3,35,Michael,"Look, we won't be long and you guys should be safe here."
3,35,Michael,"Actually, scratch that."
3,35,Michael,"We're all screwed, 'cause a bunch more demons just showed up."
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's too many of 'em.
3,35,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do we do?
3,35,Janet,I have an idea.
3,35,Janet,I think I can take you into my void.
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,That sounds fun!
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,Let's go into a void!
3,35,Michael,"Okay, let's go."
3,35,Janet,"Just to be clear, I don't know if you'll survive in my void, but either way, all of you will definitely die on Earth when I do this."
3,35,Janet,"So, look around and say goodbye."
3,35,Jason Mendoza,"Goodbye, Earth!"
3,35,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, did you just say we're gonna die?"
3,36,Michael,Wow!
3,36,Michael,"Janet, you did it!"
3,36,Michael,You brought us into your void!
3,36,Michael,"If I had a heart, it would be pounding."
3,36,Janet,Michael --
3,36,Michael,"You'd think there'd be side effects, but I feel great."
3,36,Michael,How's the hair?
3,36,Michael,Is it still amazing?
3,36,Janet,"Michael, there may have been some side effects for the humans."
3,36,Michael,Huh.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Dude, why are there so many Janets?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,And why do I sound like Janet?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You also look like Janet.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Do I?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Why?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,What?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,What is happening?
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"Oh, no."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,Am I wearing a vest?
3,36,Tahani-Janet,Oh!
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"Michael, help me!"
3,36,Michael,This is gonna be tricky.
3,36,Michael,How do we even tell them apart?
3,36,Jason-Janet,Oh!
3,36,Michael,"Okay, that one's Jason."
3,36,Janet,"I can't put the humans back in their own bodies, so I've done the next best, but still not that great, thing."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,A high-neck sleeveless?
3,36,Tahani-Janet,I suppose this outfit will do.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Are you sure?
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"I mean, wearing a floral print to an infinite void at this time of the nothing?"
3,36,Chidi-Janet,So where are we exactly?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"We're not on Earth, right?"
3,36,Janet,"That's correct, Chidi-Janet."
3,36,Janet,You're not.
3,36,Janet,"Your real bodies dematerialized when you entered my void, and your essences reconstituted themselves in this form."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Cool, cool."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"And when you say ""void"""
3,36,Janet,"Oh, I mean a subdimension outside of space and time, at the nexus of consciousness and matter, tethered to my essence."
3,36,Janet,Does that help?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,It does not help.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Makes it way worse.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,I just wanna lie down.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Where is down?
3,36,Jason-Janet,I found it.
3,36,Jason-Janet,It's up here.
3,36,Jason-Janet,It's dope!
3,36,Janet,I have an idea.
3,36,Jason-Janet,Sweet!
3,36,Jason-Janet,I call sofa.
3,36,Michael,"Janet's void has a back door to the Janet Warehouse in the Neutral Zone, which is right near Accounting."
3,36,Michael,You four will stay here while actual Janet and I sneak through it and find the Head Accountant.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"But, Michael, why can't we go with you?"
3,36,Janet,"Well, you just died, which means you're the first humans in history to not immediately go to the Good or Bad Place, which, in turn, makes you interdimensional fugitives."
3,36,Janet,"So, that's neat."
3,36,Michael,"Also, the Judge is probably still pissed at me, for, you know, breaking all the rules and she might take it out on you."
3,36,Michael,"Plus, the Bad Place is probably hunting for us."
3,36,Michael,"So, literally, the entire universe is against you."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Okay, but what's a fourth really good reason?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Jeez.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Just trying to lighten the mood.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Tough void.
3,36,Michael,"Now, Janet and I will pose as Good Place employees, and sweet talk the Accountant into showing us his books."
3,36,Michael,"If I'm right, we will find proof that the Bad Place is tampering with the points system."
3,36,Michael,The Accountant will tell us what to do and this will all be over.
3,36,Michael,"We're almost at the end, guys."
3,36,Michael,Just stay here and keep Janet's heads on straight.
3,36,Janet,Bye!
3,36,Michael,Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet?
3,36,Janet,That's a Neutral Janet.
3,36,Janet,She's sort of the black sheep of the Janet world.
3,36,Janet,"Or blank sheep, I guess."
3,36,Janet,Ooh!
3,36,Janet,I can throw shade now.
3,36,Janet,That's cool.
3,36,Neutral Janet,You've arrived at the Accounting office.
3,36,Neutral Janet,All point calculations for actions taken on Earth are made here.
3,36,Neutral Janet,End of conversation.
3,36,Michael,My name is Michael.
3,36,Michael,I need to speak with the Head Accountant on official Good Place business.
3,36,Neutral Janet,"I will inform the Head Accountant of your presence, and he either will or will not see you in a certain amount of time."
3,36,Neutral Janet,End of conversation.
3,36,Michael,Wow!
3,36,Michael,"Good thing your void plan worked out, huh?"
3,36,Janet, believe in life after love.
3,36,Janet,Mmm.
3,36,Janet,Having four humans in my void is weird.
3,36,Michael,Ah.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,This is nuts.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,We're in a void in the body of a white lady --
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Not a lady.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"Not a lady, darling."
3,36,Jason-Janet,But we are white.
3,36,Jason-Janet,Let's all say white people things.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"""Billy Joel""."
3,36,Jason-Janet,"""I found it on Etsy."""
3,36,Jason-Janet,"""There was nowhere to park!"""
3,36,Jason-Janet,"""Did you refill the Brita?"""
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"I find this void quite calming, actually."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"It's like, this time, the Xanax took me."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Oh, I have the worst stomachache."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Dude, relax."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Here, let me see if I can figure this out."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Oh!
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Wow!
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Eleanor, how'd you do that?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I don't know.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,We're Janets now.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"So, I thought we'd have some bitchin' Janet powers."
3,36,Janet,What just happened?
3,36,Janet,What did you do?
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Sorry, I'm just trying to help Chidi calm --"
3,36,Janet,The structural integrity of this void is already at risk.
3,36,Janet,"You can't start randomly conjuring up objects, or it might shatter the void."
3,36,Janet,"Yes, it might."
3,36,Janet,It might make everything blow up and we'll all disappear forever.
3,36,Janet,"So, stop it!"
3,36,Michael,Everything okay?
3,36,Janet,Nope.
3,36,Michael,Well
3,36,Neutral Janet,The Head Accountant has decided to see you.
3,36,Neutral Janet,This will happen now.
3,36,Neutral Janet,End of conversation.
3,36,Janet,Hi.
3,36,Neil,Heyo!
3,36,Neil,There they are.
3,36,Neil,Good to see you.
3,36,Neil,Sorry to keep you waiting.
3,36,Neil,"I'm Neil, Head Accountant."
3,36,Neil,You must be Janet and Michael.
3,36,Michael,Yes.
3,36,Neil,"Can I just say, I really depreciate you coming."
3,36,Neil,Uh?
3,36,Neil,Little bit of accounting humor.
3,36,Michael,Ah!
3,36,Neil,Yeah.
3,36,Neil,"So, what can I do for you?"
3,36,Michael,"Well, I'm concerned about certain anomalies in the points system."
3,36,Michael,I'm worried that somehow the Bad Place has been tampering.
3,36,Neil,Tampering?
3,36,Neil,"No, no."
3,36,Neil,Quite impossible.
3,36,Neil,"Laughable, really."
3,36,Neil,"Janet, can you remind me to laugh at that later?"
3,36,Neutral Janet,Your amusement has been scheduled.
3,36,Neutral Janet,End of conversation.
3,36,Neil,She's a lot of fun.
3,36,Michael,"Could you just humor us, though?"
3,36,Michael,Show us how the system works.
3,36,Neil,Ah!
3,36,Neil,"Well, I suppose I could give you a quick tour."
3,36,Neil,We don't get a lot of visitors.
3,36,Neil,Follow me.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Eleanor, how'd you know I always wanted a dog like this?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Funny story, it's one of the things I saw in the alternate timeline where we were soulmates on and off for 300 years."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Maybe we should talk about that?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Well, I suppose we can, but there's not that much to talk about."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"The things you saw weren't part of my life, so they didn't happen to me."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"What the hell are you talking about, man?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Of course it was you.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I saw it.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Well, it was a Chidi, sure, but it wasn't me Chidi."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"This is a classic philosophical question, the concept of the self, or who we are."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Philosophically speaking, there's the Chidi I am, who lived a certain life, and there's the Chidi you saw, your soulmate or whatever, who had some entirely different life."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Not the same Chidis.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I'm so sorry.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Yeah, no, I get it."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Counterpoint, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said, and you do not deserve a puppy!"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I'm un-blooping your puppy!
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Things are getting cuter and I want them to get less cute!
3,36,Neil,"So, this is the main feed."
3,36,Neil,"Every action by every human on Earth is recorded, and then sent here to be assigned a point value based on the absolute moral worth of that action."
3,36,Neil,"For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan, just decided to have a destination wedding."
3,36,Neil,"Negative 1,200 points."
3,36,Neil,"Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding."
3,36,Neil,"Negative 4,300."
3,36,Neil,The theme's Lord of the Rings.
3,36,Neil,They're basically doomed.
3,36,Neil,Oh!
3,36,Neil,Here's fun.
3,36,Neil,This means that someone has just done something which has never been done before.
3,36,Michael,"Richard Moore of Sugar Land, Texas, hollowed out an eggplant and filled it with hot sauce and nickels."
3,36,Neil,"And, amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing."
3,36,Neil,"99% of all new human behaviors are weird sex things, but not in this --"
3,36,Neil,"Oh, no, it is a weird sex thing."
3,36,Neil,Yeah.
3,36,Neil,"Well, then we zip that over to the relevant departments."
3,36,Neil,"In this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed Vegetable Department."
3,36,Neil,"We've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things."
3,36,Matt,I'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate suicide.
3,36,Neil,Request denied.
3,36,Neil,I love Matty.
3,36,Neil,He's hilarious.
3,36,Michael,"So, they now examine the action, its use of resources, the intentions behind it, its effects on others --"
3,36,Neil,"Correct, and you end up with this."
3,36,Neil,And here is why tampering is impossible.
3,36,Neil,"Because this score is then double-checked by three billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official."
3,36,Neil,Anyone who does this same action in the exact same way loses this many points.
3,36,Neil,"When people die, their biographical history and final point totals are sent to the relevant destination."
3,36,Neil,This batch is going to the Bad Place.
3,36,Neil,"Thank you, Doris."
3,36,Neil,The system is flawless and tampering is quite impossible.
3,36,Michael,I see.
3,36,Michael,"Could we look at one specific file, though, just to make sure?"
3,36,Neil,Oh.
3,36,Neil,Who do you wanna see?
3,36,Neil,Genghis Khan?
3,36,Neil,Marie-Antoinette?
3,36,Neil,Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff in his file.
3,36,Michael,Doug Forcett.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"I don't get this, man."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Why wouldn't you want to know what our life was like?
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,You're not even a little bit curious what it was like to hit this?
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I don't mean this-this.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Although, frankly, I would also hit this-this."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"I don't want to see those memories because, philosophically speaking, they're none of my business."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,They happened to someone else.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Let me explain.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Take a seat.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"""Conceptions of the Self""."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Let's start with John Locke, who believed that personal identity was based on having a continued consciousness."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Essentially, memory."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Memories are links in a chain that together form a single self.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"If I can't remember what happened, because it happened to a Chidi from another timeline, it's not a unified me."
3,36,Jason-Janet,Just because you don't remember doing something doesn't mean you didn't do it.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"I have no idea how it happened, but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt that says ""Jasom""."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,That brings us to Derek Parfit.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,It does?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Parfit said, ""Even if I have memories from an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily mean it was me."""
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"After all, if my brain was split in two and each half was put in a different person, which one is me?"
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"All I know is that other Chidi doesn't exist anymore, and this one does, so this must be the real Chidi."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,And all I know is that you're just barfing Wikipedia all over everyone to avoid talking about your feelings.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Let's talk about David Hume.
3,36,Neil,Hmm.
3,36,Neil,"Here we go, the Book of Dougs."
3,36,Neil,Let's have a look.
3,36,Neil,Doug Forbush Forcap Doug L. Forcett.
3,36,Neil,"Hey, no peeking."
3,36,Neil,Accountants only.
3,36,Michael,Can you just tell me his total so far?
3,36,Neil,"Looks like he's at 520,000 points."
3,36,Neil,"Well done, Doug."
3,36,Michael,"So, that's that's good?"
3,36,Neil,"Oh, it's excellent."
3,36,Neil,Wait.
3,36,Neil,He's 68 years old?
3,36,Neil,"Well, that's terrible."
3,36,Neil,He's screwed.
3,36,Michael,I knew it!
3,36,Michael,Doug has spent his entire life being nothing but good.
3,36,Michael,"He once found a dollar on the ground and he sent it to the Canadian government to help pay down their national debt, and he isn't even close to getting in?"
3,36,Michael,How can that be?
3,36,Neil,"Look, mate, the points are indisputable."
3,36,Neil,They have been since the beginning.
3,36,Michael,"""Og gives his rock to Grog."""
3,36,Neil,First ever act of human altruism.
3,36,Neil,"Og earned 10,000 points that day."
3,36,Neil,"Course, then Grog used that rock to beat Og's brains in and lost a million points."
3,36,Neil,"Point is, the math is cold, objective and airtight."
3,36,Neil,"And unless you can prove otherwise, I don't know how I can help you."
3,36,Matt,I just got 700 new Weird Sex Thing files in the last one second.
3,36,Neil,"Oh, yeah, Burning Man just started."
3,36,Neil,"Buckle up, Matty!"
3,36,Neil,It's going to be a long week.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"So, in essence, Hume thought that we don't truly have a self."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,We're just a bundle of our ever-changing impressions.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Just admit it, man."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,You're embarrassed you fell in love with an Arizona trash bag.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Eleanor, it's not personal."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Someone fell in love with you.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,It's just not me.
3,36,Janet,I told you not to conjure anything!
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Sorry.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,I just swapped the living room for a classroom.
3,36,Janet,"Not you, him."
3,36,Janet,"Jason, what is wrong with you?"
3,36,Jason-Janet,"Sorry, Janet."
3,36,Jason-Janet,I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"I was just thinking about how much fun we used to have, hanging out in his broken hot tub and then he showed up."
3,36,Pillboi,"Yeah, I was just chillin' being nothing."
3,36,Pillboi,"Then, all of a sudden, I was."
3,36,Janet,"Goodbye, Pillboi."
3,36,Pillboi,"Ah, dip, I'm not again."
3,36,Janet,Oh you need to hurry.
3,36,Janet,My molecular essence is fragmenting and it's giving me the worst headache.
3,36,Michael,"Okay, here's a question, if Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?"
3,36,Michael,Let's look at one more file.
3,36,Michael,Someone's who's gotten into the Good Place this year.
3,36,Neil,All right.
3,36,Neil,Why don't we look at no one.
3,36,Neil,No one got in.
3,36,Michael,No one's gotten in for a year?
3,36,Neil,Correct.
3,36,Michael,How about the last three years?
3,36,Neil,All right.
3,36,Neil,Uh ah no one.
3,36,Michael,When was the last time someone got in?
3,36,Neil,The last time someone got enough points to get into the Good Place was 521 years ago.
3,36,Janet,Michael um
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Yo, homie."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,You and Eleanor were fighting before and I couldn't help but overhear.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Hey, if we hear with our ears, why is it called ""butt overhearing""?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Bro, if you don't like her, you should just tell her."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,It's not about whether I like Eleanor.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"I got into philosophy to try to make sense of a world that almost never makes sense, and that was before I learned that I died, and then un-died and then re-died."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,I just can't take one more thing.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,It's too much.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I'm gonna tell you a story.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Back in Jacksonville, there was this guy in my 80-person dance crew named Stank Toby --"
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Hang on.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,It was a 60-person dance crew.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Um oh, dip!"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,What are numbers?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You're not Jason-Janet.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You're Eleanor-Janet pretending to be Jason-Janet.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,That is so wrong and so confusing!
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"What was I supposed to do, man?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,You wouldn't talk to me.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,This seemed like the only option.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor."
3,36,Jason-Janet,I'm Arizona shrimp horny!
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"That's not what I sound like, Jason."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Get out of here!
3,36,Jason-Janet,"Oh, dip."
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,"Look, you know what?"
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Just forget it!
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,What am I even doing?
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I'm chasing a dude who isn't into me.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,I don't even know who I am anymore.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Uh-oh.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,This is new.
3,36,Eleanor 1,I'm so annoyed at myself!
3,36,Eleanor 1,Stupid Eleanor!
3,36,Eleanor 1,Stupid!
3,36,Eleanor 1,"This whole thing sucks, you know?"
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Eleanor, you're not --"
3,36,Eleanor 2,"The one thing I never wanted to do, ever, for any reason, was to follow some guy around like a lame puppy dog."
3,36,Eleanor 2,"I mean, look at me."
3,36,Eleanor 2,I don't need to do that.
3,36,Eleanor 2,I can get any guy I want.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"Eleanor, just hang on."
3,36,Eleanor 3,"What, dude?"
3,36,Eleanor 3,What?
3,36,Eleanor 3,What do you want?
3,36,Janet,What is going on?
3,36,Janet,"Okay, well, this is bad."
3,36,Eleanor 4,Why are you staring at me?
3,36,Eleanor 4,Do I have a zit on my nose or something?
3,36,Janet,Your sense of self is crumbling and it's taking the void down with it.
3,36,Eleanor 5,Great.
3,36,Eleanor 5,"So, I don't feel like myself for two seconds and it breaks the universe?"
3,36,Eleanor 5,How come nothing went wrong when Chidi freaked out about his identity for three hours?
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Because freaking out about everything is my identity.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Not to brag.
3,36,Janet,I need you to hold it together.
3,36,Janet,Try to do something Eleanor-y.
3,36,Janet,Laugh at someone who falls down or show up to an event underdressed and get mad at everyone else somehow.
3,36,Janet,I'll be right back.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"I know I asked you this before, but --"
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"No, darling."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,This is not where the Mac and PC guys live.
3,36,Jason-Janet,Whoa!
3,36,Jason-Janet,Check out this dope flat screen.
3,36,Jason-Janet,It's air-mounted!
3,36,Jason-Janet,"Do you see this, Tahani?"
3,36,Tahani-Janet,This must be where Janet stores all her information.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,This screen can literally show us anything that has ever happened.
3,36,Jason-Janet,Cartoons!
3,36,Jason-Janet,Cartoons!
3,36,Jason-Janet,I think it's broken.
3,36,Jason-Janet,"TV, play cartoons for Jason."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"Oh, my."
3,36,Tahani-Janet,Janet has a crush on you.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,I'm sorry.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,It's not just a crush.
3,36,Tahani-Janet,"I think, in one of the reboots, you and Janet were married."
3,36,Jason-Janet,Whoa!
3,36,Jason-Janet,Married?
3,36,Jason-Janet,Oh this flat screen must have been a wedding present.
3,36,Jason-Janet,It's all starting to make sense now.
3,36,Neil,"Well, I've gotta run."
3,36,Neil,We're having a little thing in the break room for Marisol's birthday.
3,36,Neil,She's turning 39 million again.
3,36,Neil,"So, if there's nothing else"
3,36,Michael,"""If there's nothing else""?"
3,36,Michael,"Neil, be logical."
3,36,Michael,Not one Good Place resident in over 500 years?
3,36,Michael,Not Jonas Salk?
3,36,Michael,Not Harriet Tubman?
3,36,Michael,Not one single Golden Girl?
3,36,Michael,The Bad Place has hacked your system!
3,36,Neil,"No, it hasn't."
3,36,Neil,How dare you?
3,36,Neil,"Frankly, I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir."
3,36,Neil,"If you've got a problem, then go to the Good Place and take it up with the Committee."
3,36,Neil,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the break room, because there's cake over there, and if I don't move quickly, Erika will get the last corner piece!"
3,36,Neil,"Good day, sir."
3,36,Michael,"Oh, no, no, this can't be happening."
3,36,Michael,"No, he was supposed to tell us what to do."
3,36,Michael,"If he's not gonna fix this, who is?"
3,36,Janet,"You, Michael."
3,36,Janet,It has to be you.
3,36,Janet,"We keep wandering around these different realms, expecting someone else to have the answer, but no one ever does."
3,36,Janet,"You're the guy, Michael."
3,36,Janet,You're the only one who can fix whatever's wrong with the afterlife.
3,36,Janet,"But before we get into that, Eleanor's identity is shattering inside my void, and I might blow up, so I'm gonna need you to grab a paper clip and marbleize me, like, yesterday."
3,36,Michael,What's gonna happen to the humans?
3,36,Janet,"No idea, but I can't take them out of my void in the middle of this office."
3,36,Janet,"And if we do nothing, everyone is gone-zo."
3,36,Janet,"Marbleize me, get us somewhere safe and bring me back."
3,36,Michael,Right.
3,36,Michael,Paper clip!
3,36,Michael,I need a paper clip!
3,36,Michael,"Hey, Matt."
3,36,Michael,Do you have a paper clip?
3,36,Matt,What are you gonna use it for?
3,36,Eleanor 6,"Chidi, I'm scared."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,I know.
3,36,Eleanor 6,What am I supposed to be doing right now?
3,36,Eleanor 6,I don't remember.
3,36,Eleanor 7,I'm having a hard time remembering.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Right.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Memories.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You need to remember who you are.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"You're Eleanor Shellstrop from Phoenix, Arizona."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Your favorite meal is shrimp scampi.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"You listed your emergency contact as Britney Spears as a long-shot way of meeting her, and your favorite movie is that clip of John Travolta saying ""Adele Dazeem""."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"You flew halfway around the world because you wanted to be a better person, and it was very brave."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You're sharp and you're strong.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,You make fun of me a lot.
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"You once called me a human snooze button, but you also showed up in my classroom when I was drowning in despair and canned chili, and you basically saved my life."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,"You have very high self-esteem, and a very low tolerance for men who wear sandals, and your worst nightmare is someone saying something nice about you to your face, but too bad, because I need to say it, because you deserve it."
3,36,Chidi-Janet,Because because
3,36,Eleanor-Janet,Chidi
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nice work, bud."
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did you mean everything you said or did you just say it because the world was ending?
3,36,Chidi Anagonye,"I really wanna play this cool, but I'm afraid that I'm gonna ruin it if I try to be sexy."
3,36,Chidi Anagonye,I already ruined it.
3,36,Chidi Anagonye,"Um saying the word ""sexy"" is not sexy."
3,36,Janet,Wait!
3,36,Michael,Oh!
3,36,Michael,Jeez.
3,36,Janet,I'm okay.
3,36,Michael,Are you sure?
3,36,Janet,Yes.
3,36,Janet,I'm okay.
3,36,Janet,Wait.
3,36,Janet,Uh-oh.
3,36,Janet,Ooh.
3,36,Michael,What?
3,36,Janet,They're not Janets anymore.
3,36,Janet,They're them and they're not sitting well.
3,36,Janet,Incoming.
3,36,Michael,"They're all here, and they're safe from the old scary thing."
3,36,Michael,"Now, there's a new scary thing,"
3,36,Neil,"Hi, guys."
3,36,Neil,I'm Neil.
3,36,Neil,Welcome to Accounting.
3,36,Neil,"Now, it does seem that four of you are interdimensional fugitives, so I did go ahead and hit the alarm."
3,36,Neil,Sorry about that.
3,36,Neil,But there is some good news.
3,36,Neil,There's some cake left.
3,36,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
3,36,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, what are we going to do?"
3,36,Michael,"Guys, I'm so sorry."
3,36,Michael,The Accountant was no help.
3,36,Neil,Rude.
3,36,Michael,No one's gotten into the Good Place in 500 years.
3,36,Michael,We have no plan.
3,36,Michael,No one's coming to save us.
3,36,Michael,So I'm gonna do it.
3,36,Michael,Follow me!
3,36,Neil,The corner piece!
3,36,Neil,No!
3,36,Neil,You can't take the Book of Dougs.
3,36,Neil,Accountants only!
3,36,Michael,I need one of you to volunteer to do something outrageously insane that will either make you cease to exist or be really fun.
3,36,Jason Mendoza,That's most of the things I've tried!
3,36,Michael,That's my guy.
3,36,Michael,Come here.
3,36,Michael,Get in the tube!
3,36,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, hell, yeah."
3,36,Jason Mendoza,I love getting in stuff!
3,36,Michael,No way to know what happened to him.
3,36,Michael,"So, come on, let's go."
3,36,Michael,"Everyone else, come up."
3,36,Michael,Here you go.
3,36,Jason Mendoza,That was awesome!
3,36,Jason Mendoza,That was awesome!
3,36,Jason Mendoza,I want to go again.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are we?
3,36,Michael,We're in the Good Place.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No offense, dude, but you have told us a lot of lies in the last 300 years, so seriously, where the fork are we?"
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fork.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shirt.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ashhole.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy forking shirtballs.
3,36,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're in the Good Place.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Are we sure we're in the actual Good Place?
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's rather carpeted.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, I don't see any go-karts, much less go-karts being driven by monkeys wearing sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't.
3,37,Michael,"No, this is definitely some part of the Good Place."
3,37,Michael,Just take a deep breath.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That smells like Typhoon Falls, my favorite water park when I was a kid."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chlorine, suntan lotion, Band-Aids and a thick cloud of teen hormones."
3,37,Michael,"When I was researching my fake neighborhood, I learned about this."
3,37,Michael,The Good Place smells like whatever makes you happiest.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Warm pretzels.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Or, no, wait."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,It's the smell of absolute moral truth?
3,37,Janet,Those two things have very similar smells.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"I smell Blake Bortles holding the Super Bowl MVP trophy as Dan Patrick says, ""This has to feel good, Blake"", and he says, ""It sure does, Dan, and I owe it all to my best friend Jason Mendoza."""
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Also, weed."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mmm.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"To me, it smells like a curtain closing between first class and economy."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ah!
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,This truly is the Good Place.
3,37,Michael,I don't think we're in the main Good Place area.
3,37,Michael,This seems like this is some kind of a mail depot.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,So we're talkin' about mailmen now.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,From heaven.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Literally had that calendar and I did not get past March.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,37,Michael,Don't.
3,37,Michael,Okay.
3,37,Michael,There are two key things that we have to do.
3,37,Michael,Make sure that no one can follow us.
3,37,Michael,Janet?
3,37,Janet,On it.
3,37,Janet,What's the second thing we have to do?
3,37,Michael,Keep a low profile.
3,37,Michael,"Okay, if there's anyone in the building, here's our cover story."
3,37,Michael,I'm an accountant.
3,37,Michael,You are a Neutral Janet.
3,37,Michael,And you four won a contest.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Really?
3,37,Michael,"Okay, not that."
3,37,Michael,I'll come up with something better.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Why do we need a cover story at all?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,These are the good guys.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Let's just come clean and request asylum.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, man, we're refugees."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,What kind of messed-up place would turn away refugees?
3,37,Michael,The main thing I've learned about the Good Place is that they never break the rules.
3,37,Michael,No way to guarantee they wouldn't send you right down to the Bad Place.
3,37,Gwendolyn,What the heck is going on in there?
3,37,Michael,Um oh!
3,37,Michael,"Hi, there."
3,37,Michael,I'm I'm an accountant.
3,37,Michael,We're coming from Accounting.
3,37,Michael,"Um, and as we were, uh, climbing through the mailbox, it it blew up."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh the explosion was caused by demons.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,We were being chased by demons.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,And a Dracula.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,There was a Dracula chasing us.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Was there, though, Jason?"
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Maybe Drac blew up the mailbox with his bazooka.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Well, geez, Louise, I'm sure glad you're okay."
3,37,Gwendolyn,My name's Gwendolyn.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Welcome to the Good Place.
3,37,Michael,"I'm Michael, and this is my Neutral Janet."
3,37,Janet,Hello.
3,37,Janet,"Also, not hello."
3,37,Janet,It's nothing to meet you.
3,37,Janet,End of statement.
3,37,Michael,Okay.
3,37,Michael,"And these four here are humans, if you can believe it."
3,37,Gwendolyn,If I can believe it?
3,37,Gwendolyn,Watch this.
3,37,Gwendolyn,I believe it!
3,37,Gwendolyn,Why are they here?
3,37,Michael,Because they won a contest.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Congratulations, guys!"
3,37,Gwendolyn,Come on in!
3,37,Gwendolyn,This is the Correspondence Center.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Make yourselves at home.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"There's a sofa, that's a bowl of fruit."
3,37,Gwendolyn,That's the door to the Good Place.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Ooh this is a fun paperweight shaped like a little hat.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"This right here is the door to, um, the Good Place?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Well, it's a door to the Good Place, but it won't open for you guys, though."
3,37,Gwendolyn,"The only door for humans is the official entrance, which is 500 trillion miles north-south-north of here."
3,37,Gwendolyn,So you're kinda just stuck inside.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Wow.
3,37,Gwendolyn,It's really weird that you guys won a contest to be in this building.
3,37,Michael,"Well, you know, take that up with the folks at Weird Contest Magazine."
3,37,Michael,"Hey, why don't we help you clean up the mess in the mail room?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,Wow.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Thanks!
3,37,Gwendolyn,Did I win a contest?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi and I will be right there.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, help me."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,She said it's not gonna open.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Oops.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is how I always got out of escape rooms.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you break enough stuff, they open the door and kick you out."
3,37,Gwendolyn,Is everything okay in there?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yup.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Okay.
3,37,Gwendolyn,No follow-up questions.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, there, Smashy, before you start grabbin' any other throwin' lamps, you have anything you need to talk about?"
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I can't take this anymore, man."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All the running, and hiding, and fighting, and this whole insane journey."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And now, all that stands between us and the actual Good Place is one door?"
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What is that, two inches thick?"
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's like four Oreos!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're four Oreos from heaven!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,It's an insane situation.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,But I am right here with you.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"So, let's take a deep breath."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,The smell of the barf from the wave pool is really helping.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,How?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
3,37,Michael,"Say, Gwendolyn"
3,37,Gwendolyn,Mmm-hmm?
3,37,Michael,I need to speak with the Committee regarding an urgent matter.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Oh, sorry, you'd have to contact them directly and that's definitely against the rules."
3,37,Michael,I see.
3,37,Michael,"How would I contact them, though, if it weren't against the rules?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Well, by calling them on that phone."
3,37,Gwendolyn,But I can't let you use it.
3,37,Michael,Right.
3,37,Michael,"And even if it weren't against the rules, I don't know the number, and you wouldn't tell me."
3,37,Gwendolyn,I couldn't.
3,37,Gwendolyn,There are no numbers.
3,37,Gwendolyn,You pick it up and it connects you to whomever you want.
3,37,Gwendolyn,But you can't use it.
3,37,Michael,Of course not.
3,37,Michael,Just as a hypothetical
3,37,Gwendolyn,Mmm-hmm?
3,37,Michael,Is there any way that you would know if I did use the phone?
3,37,Michael,Any kind of alarm?
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Golly, no!"
3,37,Michael,So it's entirely untraceable?
3,37,Gwendolyn,Sure is.
3,37,Gwendolyn,What a fun thought experiment.
3,37,Michael,"You said it, Gwendolyn."
3,37,Gwendolyn,Uh-huh.
3,37,Michael,"Sorry, is that a dog barking in another room?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,I doubt it because I don't have a dog.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"But out of politeness and an abundance of caution, I'll go check."
3,37,Gwendolyn,Hello?
3,37,Gwendolyn,Doggie?
3,37,Michael,My name is Michael.
3,37,Michael,I'm an accountant.
3,37,Michael,I need to speak with the Committee immediately on the top floor of the Correspondence Center.
3,37,Michael,Thank you.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, you seem thoughtful."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,And that concerns me.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Do you remember that one time when we were in Janet's void, and we all looked like Janet?"
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I do, yes."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,You know how I saw that thing about how Janet loves me?
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"I don't know how I feel about her, and also, I feel bad that I sort of, like, read her diary and she doesn't know."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,What should I do?
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, perhaps you should tell Janet what you saw."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,And start a dialog about your feelings.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Who knows if a relationship will take hold, but you must begin from a place of honesty."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Thanks, Tahani."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,It's nice to know I can talk about girls with my wife.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Janet."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Uh.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"So, do you remember how you killed us and brought us into your void?"
3,37,Janet,"I do, yes."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"When we were in there, I was wondering around, because you have the ability to make anything, and I wanted to see where you keep the Rollerblades."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,And I accidentally saw that video thing about how you love me.
3,37,Janet,You saw that?
3,37,Janet,That's so embarrassing.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, it kinda freaked me out at first."
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"But, hey, let's talk about it."
3,37,Janet,I don't want to talk about this.
3,37,Janet,"You guys were in my void, and it was exhausting, and I almost blew up, and I have to be neutral, and Neutral Janets don't have feelings"
3,37,Gwendolyn,How's it going in here?
3,37,Janet,It is going neutrally.
3,37,Janet,End of conversation.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Can we just --
3,37,Janet,End of conversation.
3,37,Michael,"You got one shot, buddy."
3,37,Michael,"Be clear, be confident, and don't let them intimidate you."
3,37,Chuck,"Oh, wow!"
3,37,Kellen,Wow.
3,37,Kellen,This place is very cool.
3,37,Paula,Have you guys ever been here before?
3,37,Chuck,No.
3,37,Chuck,No.
3,37,Paula,I have never been here before.
3,37,Andie,I love it.
3,37,Andie,So charming.
3,37,Meg,I love the architecture.
3,37,Chuck,Really great.
3,37,Michael,"Hello, everyone."
3,37,Michael,I'm Michael.
3,37,Michael,Thank you for coming.
3,37,Chuck,"No, thank you for asking us to come."
3,37,Chuck,"It is one of the great honors of my eternal life to be invited here by you, today, for this momentous occasion."
3,37,Chuck,"Now, who are you and why are we here?"
3,37,Michael,"Well, in a nutshell, I believe that the Bad Place has somehow infiltrated the Accounting Department, and is tampering with the points system."
3,37,Paula,My goodness.
3,37,Paula,That would be a disaster.
3,37,Paula,Everyone focus up.
3,37,Paula,"Meg, you take notes."
3,37,Paula,"Daisuke, open a secure channel to headquarters."
3,37,Paula,"Kellen, head to the farmers' market and grab us fresh peaches."
3,37,Kellen,I think pluots are in season.
3,37,Chuck,"Then get pluots, Kellen."
3,37,Chuck,Get as many pluots as can fit in your tote bag.
3,37,Chuck,We are gonna be here a while.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Brought you some water.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I mean, there's not a kitchen, but I found this kind of glowing bowl with liquid in it."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe it was a toilet.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna throw this out.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What are you doing?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Trying to jimmy the lock, but everything I stick in here just turns to glitter."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"All right, forget about the door, look at me."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Right now, we're together in heaven, basically."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,And we're in love.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Compared to some of the other stuff that's happened to us, it could be worse."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I guess ""try and enjoy this"" is a better plan than ""have the anxiety sweats""."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, check it out."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Straight through my sweatshirt.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, I have an idea to take your mind off the door."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Let's go on a date.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I'm serious."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Why not have our first date four Oreos away from paradise?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,You still wanna go out with me after I just showed you my anxiety sweats?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, you must really be into me."
3,37,Michael,"You have to admit, it's very odd that no one has gotten into the Good Place for 500 years."
3,37,Chuck,"Well, there've been dips before."
3,37,Chuck,"Remember, like, 200,000 years ago when they invented stabbing, and they were all just, like, stabbing each other?"
3,37,Michael,"Again, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett."
3,37,Michael,The man has lived a selfless life and he's not even close to getting in.
3,37,Michael,The only explanation is that the Bad Place has somehow rigged the system.
3,37,Meg,I wouldn't put it past them.
3,37,Meg,Every single Bad Place employee is a disgusting monster.
3,37,Michael,"Well, some of them are probably cool, handsome, man-about-town types."
3,37,Paula,"Committee, Michael the accountant has brought us evidence of a problem, and now it is up to us to find a solution."
3,37,Andie,"While you wait, Kellen will stand by you, showering you with compliments."
3,37,Kellen,"Great job, Michael."
3,37,Kellen,You are such a good speaker.
3,37,Kellen,This suit is very flattering.
3,37,Kellen,You have a lot of gravitas.
3,37,Michael,"I thought I was going to be annoyed by this, but it's wonderful."
3,37,Kellen,Your jawline is extraordinary.
3,37,Kellen,You're a nice height.
3,37,Kellen,Your energy is electric.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"I gotta say, it's been really nice having a little company."
3,37,Janet,It's nice to be here and it's not nice to not be there.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"So, how'd you two meet?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,Was it through the contest?
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Tahani and I met in Brain School.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,And then we got married because nothing mattered.
3,37,Gwendolyn,And you're both so attractive.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Are all humans as attractive as you two?
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
3,37,Gwendolyn,Fantastic.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Say, Jason, can you help me get more wicker baskets from the other room?"
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Sure thing.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm so sorry, darling."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is all my fault.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I encouraged Jason to come clean about what we saw.
3,37,Janet,"You saw that, too?"
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
3,37,Janet,Jason knows that I love him.
3,37,Janet,"It stinks to hear about how the two of you are married, this beige outfit really washes out my not-skin, and if I don't remain neutral in front of Gwendolyn, she's gonna know we've been lying."
3,37,Janet,"All of these new emotions I'm feeling are about to burst out of me, which might be super embarrassing."
3,37,Janet,What if they come out my butt?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Whoa!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Champagne!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Found it in the cupboard.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think it was a gift.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I feel kinda bad.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What if it was for something really important?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Gwendolyn, here's some champagne for you for thanking me for thanking you for thanking me for thanking you for thanking me for the champagne you sent me."""
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Pop that bench!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is my kind of scrappy fun.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sneaking around with a boy, trying not to get caught."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,It's like when my parents would go to a symposium and I would sneak into their office and read the unabridged dictionary.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't believe I'm attracted to you.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"You are, though."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not worried about that anymore.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,You blew it when you admitted it to me.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,You still thinking about what's on the other side of that door?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not really, no."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because you're here with me, on this side."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I have one more little surprise for you.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, open 'em."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Holy forking fork!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What do you think?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no, you're crying."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I assume it's because you're happy.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Or horny?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Is this a horny cry?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm crying because I'm miserable, and it's all your fault."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Do you not like the outfit?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love the outfit!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,You look amazing!
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And this sucks, and I'm furious!"
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I'm the happiest I've ever been, and I blame you!"
3,37,Paula,"In light of this new information, the time has come to take decisive action."
3,37,Michael,Wow.
3,37,Michael,Can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.
3,37,Chuck,We're gonna form an elite investigative team to get to the bottom of this.
3,37,Chuck,And we are fast-tracking the process.
3,37,Chuck,It'll take no more than 400 years.
3,37,Michael,Sorry?
3,37,Paula,"It's aggressive, but you heard right."
3,37,Paula,We are only giving ourselves 400 years to select the members of this elite team.
3,37,Michael,"Wait, 400 years just to form the team?"
3,37,Michael,I was thinking that we could do something now-ish.
3,37,Michael,"Like, right now."
3,37,Meg,"Michael, we have rules, procedures."
3,37,Meg,We're the good guys.
3,37,Meg,We can't just do stuff.
3,37,Paula,No.
3,37,Chuck,"Upon formation, the team will then be in charge of organizing a blue ribbon commission to investigate themselves to make sure there's no conflicts of interest."
3,37,Chuck,"And that will take 1,000 years."
3,37,Michael,Okay.
3,37,Michael,"Just so you know, the whole time you're doing this, the bad guys are continuing to torture everyone who ends up in the Bad Place."
3,37,Michael,Which is everyone!
3,37,Andie,And that deeply concerns us.
3,37,Andie,Have you seen the memoranda we've sent each other about how concerned we are?
3,37,Andie,We're taking this very seriously.
3,37,Kellen,"Hear, hear."
3,37,Chuck,"Ooh, Kellen, did you file a ""hear, hear"" memorandum?"
3,37,Kellen,No.
3,37,Kellen,Sincerest apologies.
3,37,Kellen,"I rescind my ""hear, hear"" and resign, effective immediately."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hey, you two."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I think I may have solved one part of our little problem.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I made up a ""Death Did Us Part"" certificate explaining that since Jason and I are dead, we are officially no longer fake married."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I know it's not your main concern, but whatever part of you was vexed by our silly arrangement, you can now both relax."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can tell by your silence and inability to make eye contact with me that I've knocked it out of the park.
3,37,Janet,It's a nice gesture.
3,37,Janet,I feel both pitied and put on the spot.
3,37,Janet,So that's fun.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,And it's a cool reminder of how I'm dead.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, forget it."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Never mind.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Misfire.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Watch this.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,There.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Canceled.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,"So, you and I are married again?"
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, we're not."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Um
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,It's okay.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Cry as long as you want.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm going to.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cause my tears taste like the nacho cheese from my favorite movie theater.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a really weird incentive to keep crying.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Relationships are stupid.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're scared you're never gonna have a real one, and then when you do, you're scared it's gonna go away."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,But here's an idea.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What if we don't worry about whatever comes next?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,There's a quote I like by Tolstoy.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"""There is only one time that is important."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Now.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"It is the only time when we have any power."""
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Have any power."""
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know that quote.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,An unverified Tyra Banks account posted that meme on Instagram.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, now I hate it."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"There is another quote, first spoken by a very wise, very attractive, occasionally very sweaty philosopher."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"""You gotta try."""
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, she was talking about making the world a better place, but I think it applies to relationships, too."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've got an idea of something we could try.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Great!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Wait.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,I think I know.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I don't want to assume."
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,What if we both write down what we think you mean?
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,What if we didn't?
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,And then --
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Ah.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, how did it go?"
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is the Committee going to help us?
3,37,Michael,The Committee is a bunch of ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.
3,37,Michael,"The Titanic is sinking, and they're writing a strongly-worded letter to the iceberg."
3,37,Michael,"I mean, how much more evidence do they need?"
3,37,Michael,The Bad Place has to be tampering with the system.
3,37,Michael,There's no other explanation.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I ask you an unrelated question?
3,37,Michael,Absolutely not.
3,37,Michael,The fate of all of humanity is at stake and time is running out.
3,37,Michael,Go ahead.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm trying to help Jason and Janet navigate some very complex feelings, but everything I do makes it worse."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,You know them better than anyone else.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,How do I just make them happy?
3,37,Michael,How do you make Jason happy?
3,37,Michael,You give him a lollipop shaped like a Transformer.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,You'd think it'd be that simple.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But every time I do something nice, it backfires."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,There are so many unintended consequences to well-intentioned actions.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,It feels like a game you can't win.
3,37,Michael,That's it.
3,37,Michael,There is another explanation.
3,37,Michael,Unintended consequences.
3,37,Michael,"Oh, Tahani, you did it."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, of course I did, darling."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did what?
3,37,Michael,"All along, I've only been looking at one Doug, but there's millions of Dougs in here."
3,37,Michael,"In 1534, Douglass Wynegarr of Hawkhurt, England, gave his grandmother roses for her birthday."
3,37,Michael,"He picked them himself, walked them over to her, she was happy, boom, 145 points."
3,37,Michael,"Now yeah, here we go."
3,37,Michael,"In 2009, Doug Ewing of Scaggsville, Maryland, also gave his grandmother a dozen roses, but he lost four points."
3,37,Michael,Why?
3,37,Michael,Because he ordered roses using a cell phone that was made in a sweatshop.
3,37,Michael,"The flowers were grown with toxic pesticides, picked by exploited migrant workers, delivered from thousands of miles away, which created a massive carbon footprint, and his money went to a billionaire racist CEO, who sends his female employees pictures of his genitals."
3,37,Michael,Whoo!
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is a very odd thing to cheer.
3,37,Michael,Don't you understand?
3,37,Michael,The Bad Place isn't tampering with points.
3,37,Michael,They don't have to.
3,37,Michael,"Because every day, the world gets a little more complicated, and being a good person gets a little harder."
3,37,Michael,Gather the others.
3,37,Michael,We have a lot to do.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we didn't really deal with my thing.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll just figure it out.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, I owe you an apology."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm very sorry I meddled.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Truly, I was only trying to help because I want you two to be happy, and because, well, I love you."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I really do.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I love you both.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm sorry.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did I say something wrong again?
3,37,Janet,No.
3,37,Janet,I'm just crying because you're such a nice and thoughtful friend.
3,37,Janet,And the emotions aren't coming out of my butt.
3,37,Janet,"They're coming out of my eyes, which is somehow just as embarrassing."
3,37,Janet,Why are you crying?
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't know.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm British.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,I never cry.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But you're saying these nice things about me, and it's making me cry."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And also, this is less important, but the carpeting is really disgusting."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why are you crying?
3,37,Jason Mendoza,I just like being a part of things.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Jason."
3,37,Gwendolyn,Two humans and a Neutral Janet crying>
3,37,Gwendolyn,In the Good Place?
3,37,Gwendolyn,"I've never been suspicious of anyone, but I think that's about to change."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no reason to be suspicious."
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I I promise you, we've done nothing untoward."
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's up, fartfaces?"
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi and I just had sex in a closet.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Michael, have you all been lying to me this whole time?"
3,37,Gwendolyn,That upsets me.
3,37,Gwendolyn,I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Oh, gosh, darn it!"
3,37,Gwendolyn,I have no choice.
3,37,Gwendolyn,I have to turn you in to the Judge.
3,37,Michael,Don't bother.
3,37,Michael,I already did.
3,37,The Doorman,"Hey, Frogman."
3,37,The Doorman,The Judge agreed to your terms.
3,37,The Doorman,She'll meet you at IHOP.
3,37,The Doorman,"So this is the Good Place, huh?"
3,37,The Doorman,Hmm.
3,37,The Doorman,Smells like frogs.
3,37,The Doorman,Cool.
3,37,The Doorman,Let's go.
3,37,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, did he just say we're going to IHOP?"
3,37,Michael,Yes.
3,37,Jason Mendoza,Tight.
3,37,Michael,No.
3,37,Michael,Not tight.
3,37,Michael,The Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes is the most dangerous place in the universe.
3,37,Tahani Al-Jamil,Then why are we going?
3,37,Michael,To save humanity.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Any chance I can change real quick?
3,37,Michael,Nope.
3,37,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
3,37,Gwendolyn,"Bye, guys!"
3,37,Gwendolyn,Nice to meet you!
4,38,Jason Mendoza,So you're telling me I can't get any pancakes at this IHOP?
4,38,Michael,It's not the place you're thinking of.
4,38,Michael,This is the Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes.
4,38,Michael,"It's the crossroads of all dimensions, like Grand Central Station, but for space and time."
4,38,Michael,"If you eat anything in this IHOP, you will literally explode."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, I know."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,It's IHOP.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why are we meeting there?
4,38,Michael,"The Judge's powers are limited in the IHOP, so she can't just retire me on the spot."
4,38,Michael,"And I believe that when she hears what I've discovered about the points system, she'll take our side."
4,38,Michael,"If not, then we'll jump through a portal to another dimension, hope our molecules don't liquefy, and regroup from there."
4,38,Michael,Excuse me.
4,38,Michael,Okay.
4,38,Michael,"Now, watch your step."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, so, yeah."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I don't wanna go in there."
4,38,Michael,I get that.
4,38,Michael,Come here.
4,38,Michael,Here are your options: option number one
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cruel, but necessary."
4,38,Michael,Oh.
4,38,Michael,Look at this.
4,38,Michael,They added a tenth dimension.
4,38,Michael,"Boy, permits must've been a headache."
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Looks like we're inside a Diane Von Furstenberg pattern from spring 2013!
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, everyone, just be cool, I know exactly what's going on."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,We all smoked too much salvia.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"We gotta ride this out for about two, three minutes, and then we'll be back in Pillboi's broken hot tub and this will all be over."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, is this a good time to talk?"
4,38,Janet,"Well, there's no time like the present."
4,38,Janet,"And here, there's neither ""no time"" nor ""the present""."
4,38,Janet,Go ahead.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"So, you know how me and you used to be married, when I was dead before?"
4,38,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,I think I'm starting to catch feelings again for you.
4,38,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"And if I don't double-die in this IHOP, and the Judge lady doesn't turn you into a marble, do you want to try being boyfriend-girlfriend?"
4,38,Janet,I'm not a girl.
4,38,Janet,"But, yes, I'd very much like to go on a date with you, somewhere, sometime."
4,38,Janet,"As opposed to here, which is nowhere, at all the times."
4,38,Janet,Do you get it?
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,38,Judge,Hey!
4,38,Judge,Butthead!
4,38,Judge,"You lie to my face, disrespect my orders, steal the only key to Earth, meddle with an already compromised timeline, kidnap the humans into a Janet's void, and now demand a meeting in the freakin' IHOP?"
4,38,Judge,I hate this place.
4,38,Michael,I wouldn't have asked for a meet if it weren't vitally important.
4,38,Michael,"And I promise, no more rule breaking."
4,38,Judge,"Oh, yeah?"
4,38,Judge,Really?
4,38,Judge,Cool.
4,38,Judge,Cause it kinda looks like you stole a book from Accounting!
4,38,Michael,No more rule breaking starting now.
4,38,Judge,"Hello, Chidi!"
4,38,Judge,That is a great look for you.
4,38,Judge,"Things don't work out here with li'l blondie, you know who to call."
4,38,Judge,This bitch.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Sorry, what is on me right now?"
4,38,Janet,Oops.
4,38,Janet,"Where'd you come from, little buddy?"
4,38,Michael,"No, don't touch it!"
4,38,Michael,"Tahani, do not touch the Neednoggle."
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Bad.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,This is all bad.
4,38,Judge,Humans are such whiners.
4,38,Judge,"Here, hot pants."
4,38,Judge,Let me take care of it for you.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Help!
4,38,Michael,Ah!
4,38,Michael,"Everybody, you're all still standing in the IHOP."
4,38,Michael,The Judge simply augmented your reality to make you feel like you're in a normal IHOP.
4,38,Michael,Very smart.
4,38,Judge,"Don't suck up to me, you suck-up."
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is far better.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Instead of a slug creature, I have a cute little scarf."
4,38,Michael,"No, no, no!"
4,38,Michael,Don't touch it.
4,38,Janet,No!
4,38,Michael,"Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle."
4,38,Michael,The Judge just made it look like a scarf.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Wonderful.
4,38,Michael,All right.
4,38,Michael,"Why don't we all sit down, so I can fill the Judge in on what we've learned?"
4,38,Michael,"Your Honor, I once stood in front of you and said I thought there was something wrong with the points system."
4,38,Michael,I finally know what it is.
4,38,Michael,"Life now is so complicated, it's impossible for anyone to be good enough for the Good Place."
4,38,Michael,"I know you don't like to learn too much about life on Earth to remain impartial, but these days, just buying a tomato at a grocery store means that you are unwittingly supporting toxic pesticides, exploiting labor, contributing to global warming."
4,38,Michael,"Humans think that they're making one choice, but they're actually making dozens of choices they don't even know they're making."
4,38,Judge,"Your big revelation is ""Life is complicated""?"
4,38,Judge,That's not a revelation.
4,38,Judge,That's a divorced woman's throw pillow.
4,38,Judge,"I mean, this guy chose this tomato."
4,38,Judge,Those are the consequences.
4,38,Judge,You don't want the consequences?
4,38,Judge,"Do the research, buy another tomato."
4,38,Judge,What else you got?
4,38,Michael,"Uh, I'll tell you what else I got."
4,38,Michael,"I got, uh I got this."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,What what are you doing?
4,38,Michael,The Backpack Kid dance!
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
4,38,Michael,"I don't know, it makes people happy?"
4,38,Michael,Is it helping?
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Can I say something?
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote --
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Boring!
4,38,Jason Mendoza,I got this.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,I want to tell you about a guy from my dance crew in Jacksonville called Big Noodle.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, we gave it our best shot, guys."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was nice knowing you.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"I used to yell at Big Noodle, 'cause he always showed up late to rehearsal."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Then one day, the swamp under my house flooded."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"I needed a place to crash, so I slept at Big Noodle's house."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs to take care of four grandparents, who all lived in the same bed, just like in Willy Wonka."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"I never yelled at Big Noodle for being late after that, 'cause I knew how hard it was for him to be there."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"And he definitely didn't have time to research what tomatoes to buy, even if he wanted to."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Possession of a non-fried vegetable is a felony in Jacksonville.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"The point is you can't judge humans, because you don't know what we go through."
4,38,Michael,"Amazingly, Your Honor, he's right."
4,38,Michael,I didn't really understand people until I went to Earth.
4,38,Michael,Maybe you should give it a shot.
4,38,Michael,"If you still don't see things our way, then we'll drop it, and you can, you know, zappy-zappy-marble-marble."
4,38,Judge,"Yeah, sure."
4,38,Judge,I'll give it a shot.
4,38,Judge,"I'll go down there, see what you guys ""go through"", and then one way or another, this is going to end."
4,38,Judge,"Hey, do you guys know a good place where I can get Mexican food?"
4,38,Judge,Oh.
4,38,Judge,Mexico.
4,38,Judge,Duh.
4,38,Michael,Oh.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, how long will she be gone?"
4,38,Michael,No way to tell.
4,38,Michael,My guess is --
4,38,Judge,"Oh, brother, that was rough."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
4,38,Judge,Sheesh!
4,38,Judge,"Earth is a mess, y'all."
4,38,Judge,Woof!
4,38,Judge,"Also, I guess I'm black, and they do not like black ladies down there."
4,38,Judge,"Crap, y'all."
4,38,Judge,This is bad.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"Where did you go, exactly?"
4,38,Judge,"Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark it's terrible everywhere, and always in a different way."
4,38,Judge,"The only place I liked was Hawaii, although I barely left the resort."
4,38,Judge,The last place I went was a Black Friday sale at an outlet mall in Michigan.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why?
4,38,Judge,For the deals!
4,38,Judge,"Earth stinks, y'all."
4,38,Judge,"It's hot and it's crowded, but somehow also cold and lonely."
4,38,Judge,I thought it was going to be so easy to make good decisions.
4,38,Judge,"The first thing I did was I Googled ""big juicy natural tomatoes"", which led me to a porn site that was for people with a sunburn fetish?"
4,38,Judge,I kind of never recovered.
4,38,Michael,Right.
4,38,Michael,That's problem number one.
4,38,Michael,Life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.
4,38,Michael,"Problem number two: even if you do somehow manage to make good decisions, you still lose points because of the unintended consequences."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, there are booby traps everywhere."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, there's this chicken sandwich that, if you eat it, it means you hate gay people, and it's delicious!"
4,38,Judge,It is.
4,38,Judge,It is so good.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,And I essentially tried to do what you suggested.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,I obsessed over every choice.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"But that was also bad, and I still got sent to the Bad Place."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I'm problem number three."
4,38,Judge,"Oh, no, you are nobody's problem, sweetheart."
4,38,Judge,"You know, we gotta figure this out."
4,38,Shawn,"And then Turtle makes a bet with Ronda Rousey, and if she loses, she has to oh, come on!"
4,38,Shawn,I was just in the middle of torturing William Shakespeare by describing the plot of the Entourage movie.
4,38,Shawn,What is this?
4,38,Judge,"Some new information has come to my attention, and I need a solution."
4,38,Judge,I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this.
4,38,Judge,"But first, let's have a change of scenery."
4,38,Janet,"Remember, guys, we're still in the IHOP, so be careful."
4,38,Judge,"Shawn, I have reason to believe that humans might be, on average, better than the points system suggests they are."
4,38,Shawn,"Counterpoint, humans are terrible."
4,38,Shawn,"Limp Bizkit, slavery, the prosecution rests."
4,38,Judge,"Gotta say, that's a solid rebuttal."
4,38,Michael,"Look, there are plenty of awful people and thoughtless jerks, and I guess Nazis, again, somehow, but there are also people who are really trying to be good, and they aren't getting close."
4,38,Shawn,"Because they're not good at being good, because they're bad."
4,38,Shawn,"The score they got on Earth is how good or bad they are, full stop, end of story."
4,38,Michael,"Then why did these four get better, over and over again, in my neighborhood?"
4,38,Michael,Why did they help each other in ways they had never helped anyone on Earth?
4,38,Shawn,I don't know.
4,38,Shawn,Maybe it's a fluke.
4,38,Shawn,"Plus, you have zero proof they did get better."
4,38,Shawn,You didn't keep track of their points.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,That's it!
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,I know what we have to --
4,38,Janet,Oh.
4,38,Janet,He forgot we're still in the IHOP.
4,38,Michael,Anybody got eyes on Chidi?
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Help!
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Help!
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please?"
4,38,Janet,I'm on it.
4,38,Janet,And got him!
4,38,Janet,Ah.
4,38,Janet,Here you go.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,I just saw a trillion different realities folding onto each other like thin sheets of metal forming a single blade.
4,38,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, the Time Knife, we've all seen it."
4,38,Michael,"Let's get back on track, bud."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, okay."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Sure.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"What I was saying, before, you know, I saw the Time Knife is this: Michael is right."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,His neighborhood gave us the chance to become better people because it removed all the variables that make life on Earth hard.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There was no rent to pay, no racism, no sexism."
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,No awards-show gift-suite publicist in-fighting.
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
4,38,Tahani Al-Jamil,Those gift suites can be a real minefield.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,But Shawn is also right.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,The four of us becoming better people could be a fluke.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"So, let's repeat the experiment."
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,It's what Simone taught us about data collection.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"Try it again, and see if you get the same results."
4,38,Michael,Of course!
4,38,Michael,"I build a new neighborhood, we choose four new people, tell them they're in the Good Place, create challenges for them, track their progress."
4,38,Michael,My guess is they will do what the original four did.
4,38,Michael,"Seek help, support each other, make wise decisions, improve."
4,38,Michael,"If they do, then it's proof that humans are not ""bad, full stop, end of story""."
4,38,Shawn,This is so stupid.
4,38,Shawn,Where would you even put this neighborhood?
4,38,Shawn,"I wouldn't allow it to be built in the Good Place, that's for sure, and I doubt you'd want to come back to my neck of the woods."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh!
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have an idea.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Mindy."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to use your backyard.
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,You need my backyard?
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,For what?
4,38,Michael,We're conducting an important experiment --
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,"Okay, you know what?"
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,I don't care.
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,"In fact, as soon as I started asking the question, I thought to myself, ""Why are you asking this?"
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,"You don't care about the answer."""
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,Do whatever you want.
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,Just leave me out of it.
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,"And if you want to talk to someone, talk to Derek."
4,38,Mindy St. Claire,I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Who's Derek?
4,38,Janet,Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.
4,38,Janet,"I made him, so he's more like my son."
4,38,Janet,"Although, I did make him because I was jealous of you and Tahani, so he's kind of my rebound booty call."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,So he's your son-rebound-booty-call.
4,38,Janet,"Fine, if you want to put labels on it, I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call."
4,38,Janet,But he doesn't mean anything to me.
4,38,Janet,"Also, Derek never really worked right."
4,38,Janet,He's a buffoon.
4,38,Janet,You have nothing to worry about.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"""How should he love thee?"
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Or how deem thee wise?
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering?"""
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, I didn't see you there."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Hi, I'm Derek."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Welcome to the Medium Place.
4,38,Janet,Derek?
4,38,Janet,Why are you so different?
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,You have Mindy to thank for that.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"See, she found a plunger sticking out of the ground behind our house."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"And every time she hits it, I pass out."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter and a little bit better."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Not to brag, but I almost have a full-grown penis now."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,It's resplendent and mostly functional.
4,38,Janet,How many times has Mindy rebooted you?
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,I don't know half a million.
4,38,Janet,What?
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,She reboots me a lot.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Sometimes when she's bored, or just needs some ""alone time""."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Sometimes just for laughs.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Shall we head inside?
4,38,Janet,Okay.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
4,38,Judge,"So, here are the rules."
4,38,Judge,Michael designs the new neighborhood however he wants.
4,38,Judge,"The Bad Place gets to choose the four new humans, but they have to be the same general level of badness as the original four."
4,38,Judge,All right?
4,38,Judge,"No serial killers, no dictators, no one who managed a boy band."
4,38,Judge,"Michael will not get the files in advance, so he does not have forever to plan, but he can then change the neighborhood however he wants."
4,38,Shawn,"Yeah, I have about a billion objections to this."
4,38,Michael,So do I.
4,38,Judge,Good.
4,38,Judge,That means it's a fair compromise.
4,38,Judge,So one last issue: where do we get all the other residents for this place?
4,38,Michael,"Well, my original neighborhood was built for torture, so everyone was a demon."
4,38,Michael,We can't have that.
4,38,Michael,I say we get them from the Good Place.
4,38,Shawn,Over my dead skin-suit.
4,38,Michael,"Well, what other option do we have?"
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Would anybody like a medium snack?
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"I, myself, will be enjoying another classy martini."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Don't mind if I do.
4,38,Janet,I can make the people.
4,38,Janet,Just like I made Derek.
4,38,Michael,Are you sure?
4,38,Janet,Yes.
4,38,Janet,"If the Judge restores my powers in the Medium Place, I can do it."
4,38,Janet,They'll be way more advanced than the original Derek.
4,38,Janet,No offense.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,None taken.
4,38,Judge,Okay.
4,38,Judge,The other residents will be comprised of Janet babies.
4,38,Judge,You will have one year of Earth time to try to improve the humans.
4,38,Judge,"I will be monitoring everything to ensure there's no cheating, and to track the humans' progress."
4,38,Judge,Deal?
4,38,Michael,Ow!
4,38,Shawn,Classic.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Ow!
4,38,Michael,Janet?
4,38,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,38,Michael,Ah.
4,38,Janet,Ready to start building?
4,38,Michael,Yes.
4,38,Janet,"I have some ideas for how to design a sort of basic neighborhood, which we can then tailor to the guests as we learn more about them."
4,38,Michael,"Now, when you say ""some ideas""?"
4,38,Janet,I have 11 trillion ideas.
4,38,Michael,Yes!
4,38,Michael,"I'm so glad you're here, Janet."
4,38,Janet,"Me, too."
4,38,Michael,All right.
4,38,Michael,"So, what's your first ""basic"" idea?"
4,38,Michael,Perfect.
4,38,Michael,So basic.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,This house was built to torture you.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Why did you have Michael recreate it exactly?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, in the memories I watched, this was where we fell in love."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So I figured, why mess with success?"
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean ugh, what am I saying?"
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,This house is stupid and you're lame and I hate you.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you, too."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is gonna be fun.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I know we have to help these new people, but most of the time we'll just get to live together, like a normal couple."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can chill out and just relax
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Have sex.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop, and study philosophy
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Horndog.
4,38,Chidi Anagonye,Nerd.
4,38,Daphne,Hi.
4,38,Daphne,I'm Daphne.
4,38,Janet,"Hi, Daphne."
4,38,Janet,I'm Janet.
4,38,Janet,I made you.
4,38,Daphne,Great.
4,38,Daphne,I'll wait for your instructions.
4,38,Daphne,Thank you for making me.
4,38,Daphne,Bye.
4,38,Michael,"Okay, Daphne's done."
4,38,Michael,Only another 185 people to go.
4,38,Michael,I'll check back in an hour.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"You're doing so good, Janet."
4,38,Janet,"Thanks, Jason."
4,38,Janet,Making people is exhausting.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Can't help but notice you're making a bunch of people.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"You know, if we pooled our resources, we could be done in two shakes of a lamb's Derek."
4,38,Jason Mendoza,Whatever.
4,38,Jason Mendoza,"Janet doesn't need your help, dude!"
4,38,Janet,"Actually, it would go a lot faster."
4,38,Janet,"Thanks, Derek."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,No problem.
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Don't worry, this is purely professional, okay?"
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,"Now, be a pal and hold my classy martini while I get down to business."
4,38,Derek Hofstetler,Let's make people.
4,38,Michael,"Hello, Your Honor."
4,38,Shawn,You fell for it!
4,38,Shawn,"It's me, Shawn."
4,38,Shawn,Just wanted to wish you bad luck.
4,38,Michael,Trying to psyche me out?
4,38,Michael,You must be scared.
4,38,Shawn,"Oh, I'm very confident."
4,38,Shawn,I think we've picked some excellent subjects for your stupid experiment.
4,38,Shawn,"When you fail, and you will, I've got something special cooked up for your four little friends."
4,38,Michael,Let me guess.
4,38,Michael,They're gonna be tortured with penis flatteners and bees with teeth.
4,38,Michael,You are so predictable.
4,38,Michael,Why don't you at least switch it up once in a while?
4,38,Michael,Try using teeth flatteners and bees with penises.
4,38,Shawn,"First of all, that's stupid."
4,38,Shawn,"But also, we are switching it up."
4,38,Shawn,"When you fail, the four humans will be tortured for all eternity."
4,38,Shawn,But guess who's going to be doing the torturing?
4,38,Vicky,"Hello, idiot."
4,38,Shawn,We built a Michael suit.
4,38,Shawn,"The boys down in R&D said it couldn't be done, so I made it out of them."
4,38,Shawn,"That's Vicky in there right now, taking you for a spin."
4,38,Vicky,You are disgusting.
4,38,Vicky,Disgusting.
4,38,Shawn,"Oh, Michael."
4,38,Shawn,"It's going to be so amazing, watching your four BFFs look so sad and betrayed and confused as you, their reformed demon daddy, unleash a swarm of penis-bees."
4,38,Shawn,I invented those.
4,38,Shawn,That was me.
4,38,Michael,"Well, I will just tell them what you're going to do, and they'll know that it isn't really me."
4,38,Shawn,And we'll erase their memories of you telling them.
4,38,Shawn,"Thanks for inventing that little trick, by the way."
4,38,Shawn,Very useful.
4,38,Shawn,"Have fun, Michael."
4,38,Shawn,Enjoy everything that is about to overwhelm you.
4,38,Shawn,"Mmm, bye, bitch!"
4,38,Vicky,"Mmm, bye, bitch!"
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, how bad is contestant number one?"
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Murderer?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,War criminal?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Instagram DJ?
4,38,Michael,"Uh, yeah."
4,38,Michael,Uh
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
4,38,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
4,38,Michael,"Yep, just a little jittery."
4,38,Michael,"Last time I designed a neighborhood, things didn't really go according to plan."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nah, plans are for wimps."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We should've done this Shellstrop-style.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't prepare at all, get drunk the morning of the test, BS our way through it, and then brag about how we didn't even study and still got a C-plus."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So whatta we got, man?"
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I gotta go give everyone a heads-up, remember?"
4,38,Michael,"Uh, his name is John."
4,38,Michael,"Some sort of journalist, no major crimes or atrocities."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he out there right now?
4,38,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's freaky.
4,38,Michael,"So, based on initial skimming of his file, we will run scenario G48-190."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Geez, Louise."
4,38,Michael,"Well, you have to be prepared for anything."
4,38,Michael,"I mean, is John coming in thinking that he belongs?"
4,38,Michael,Or does he know he definitely doesn't?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, dude, relax."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All we have to do today is tell John he's in the Good Place, show him around the neighborhood, and get him to Tahani's welcome party."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's it.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can deal with the rest later.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
4,38,Michael,Right.
4,38,Michael,"Right, right, right."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, listen whatever your plan is, it's gonna be great."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We trust you.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your friends will always trust you.
4,38,Michael,"Okay, here I go."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I'm gonna"
4,38,Michael,Yup.
4,38,Michael,Here I go.
4,38,Michael,I go here and I'm gone.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael?
4,38,Michael,"Oh, yeah."
4,38,Michael,I'm gone.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
4,38,Michael,I can't do this.
4,38,John Wheaton,Hello?
4,38,John Wheaton,Is anyone here?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, buddy."
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,John is awake.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to open the door and welcome him into the afterlife.
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,Remember?
4,38,Eleanor Shellstrop,The whole plan?
4,38,Michael,I do remember.
4,38,Michael,That's why I can't do it.
4,38,Michael,It's too too scary.
4,38,Michael,No!
4,38,John Wheaton,Hello?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, listen."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a guy out there who's awake and doesn't know what's happening.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You gotta pull it together!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've got this.
4,39,Michael,No.
4,39,Michael,I absolutely do not.
4,39,Michael,"I'm not meant for any of this, Eleanor."
4,39,Michael,I'm just middle management!
4,39,Michael,What if I fail?
4,39,Michael,It'll be like the failure to end all failures.
4,39,Michael,It'll be an epic fail.
4,39,Michael,"Is my tie getting tighter, or is my neck getting fatter, somehow?"
4,39,Michael,Oh!
4,39,Michael,This is what we do.
4,39,Michael,We tell the Judge we have to cancel the experiment because I have a fat neck.
4,39,Michael,She'll understand.
4,39,John Wheaton,Anyone?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Michael, listen."
4,39,Michael,Just --
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can do this.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You are Michael.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You are smart and capable, and you're a fearless leader."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you are gonna take a deep breath, stand up, open that door, and say, ""Hi, John."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Michael.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm the architect.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on in."""
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Got it?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, John."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm the architect.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on in.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So let me sum this up for you, John."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya dead.
4,39,John Wheaton,What?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,But don't worry.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's okay that you're dead, because you, John Wheaton, are in the Good Place."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're here because of all the incredible things you did on Earth, which are all right in front of me."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, let me just check your file."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Good.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, that's what I thought."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, John, what a life you've led."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, did I introduce Michael?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's my assistant.
4,39,Michael,Hi.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,He just transferred over here from dog heaven.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you know, he's still getting used to people."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you say I show you around the neighborhood?
4,39,John Wheaton,"So, are you, like an angel or something?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, John!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Aren't you sweet?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Enough about me.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,So everything you see is here for you to enjoy for eternity.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You and your 321 neighbors.
4,39,John Wheaton,"Oh, why is it 322 people?"
4,39,John Wheaton,Is that number significant somehow?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well Janet?
4,39,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's me, Eleanor, the architect of the neighborhood."
4,39,Janet,"Yep, that is certainly information that I already knew."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet is a walking database of all the knowledge in the universe.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And since you, John, seemed to like asking a relentless number of questions, go ahead, ask her anything."
4,39,John Wheaton,"Okay, what's the craziest secret celebrity hook-up?"
4,39,Janet,"Drake and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on and off for years."
4,39,John Wheaton,Okay!
4,39,John Wheaton,Wow!
4,39,John Wheaton,"Wait, so you really do know everything?"
4,39,John Wheaton,Kinda seems like she should be running the neighborhood.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, John."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In retrospect, that does seem like a much better idea."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Janet, why don't you take John inside to get some fro-yo?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll catch up with you later!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Get over here now, dummy!"
4,39,Michael,I'm sorry.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, guys, guys, guys"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Uh-oh.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Michael looks like me.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,That's bed.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Fun little update, Michael is feeling a bit overwhelmed."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, new plan."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm now the architect!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,And stop making those faces because I already told John and there's no going back now.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, if I could pick anyone to impersonate an immortal deity well, it would be me, but if it couldn't be me, it'd be you!"
4,39,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, you're gonna rock this."
4,39,Jason Mendoza,You're like the Blake Bortles of whatever's going on right now.
4,39,Jason Mendoza,I'm not really sure.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, guys."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think I can be the architect.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I saw how Michael ran the neighborhood in the memories he showed me, and there was, like, a four-year period where Brad Pitt really wanted everyone to know how into architecture he was, and I read a lot of those interviews, so I think that might help me."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And before long, Michael will be back to his old self and he can step in and take over, right?"
4,39,Michael,"Look at the four of you, all together."
4,39,Michael,"Oh, I love you so much!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, have Janet translate the gibberish of these files."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, continue working on the welcome party."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, yes, the party!"
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, for the napkins, I would normally do a queen's tuck, but I was thinking of shaking things up a bit with a Yorkshire butterfly."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,And this could not matter less.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Very sorry.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Goodbye.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,How's it going?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,This is overwhelming.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,It's every thought and decision and action from this guy's entire life.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, this whole box is just one trip to Wendy's."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, keep reading."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"According to Michael, I usually asked for your help by, like, day two, so you need to be ready."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At first, I was kinda nervous, but so far I think I'm doing okay."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's like I became such a good person, I almost forgot I'm a world-class liar, baby!"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Very fun thing to hear from your girlfriend.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,You're doing great.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"And I have to admit, you being the architect is kinda hot."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,It's kinda like I'm secretly dating my boss.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Not that I ever would've done that.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, no, me neither."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, same."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Same.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, I gotta get ready for the next person."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, then, I will say goodbye to you platonically, the same way a resident would say goodbye to an architect."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor!
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,What if John had seen us?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm scared, and yet, somehow turned on?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Scared is the best way to be horny!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now who's doing the teaching?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, now, all right!"
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,A little higher.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
4,39,John Wheaton,Tahani Al-Jamil?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Do I know you?
4,39,John Wheaton,"No, no."
4,39,John Wheaton,But I know you.
4,39,John Wheaton,"I used to write about you all the time on my blog, The Gossip Toilet!"
4,39,John Wheaton,"We were the ones that invented the Olsen twins countdown clock, for when they became legal?"
4,39,John Wheaton,That was our blog!
4,39,John Wheaton,That was us.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, my."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,You were quite mean to me.
4,39,John Wheaton,"Oh, no, I wouldn't call it mean."
4,39,John Wheaton,Okay?
4,39,John Wheaton,"My targets were rich and high status, and I was just doing the important work of telling truth to power."
4,39,John Wheaton,"So wait, what about you?"
4,39,John Wheaton,Huh?
4,39,John Wheaton,You died in Canada?
4,39,John Wheaton,Ah!
4,39,John Wheaton,That is so weird and embarrassing.
4,39,John Wheaton,It's like the nipslip of dying.
4,39,John Wheaton,"Okay, listen, we're gonna catch up later."
4,39,John Wheaton,I can't wait to hear all about your new nose.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no, I didn't get a nose job."
4,39,John Wheaton,I know.
4,39,John Wheaton,"I figured we're in heaven, so we might as well fix all of our flaws, right?"
4,39,John Wheaton,"Like, look at me."
4,39,John Wheaton,Nothing is staying on this face.
4,39,John Wheaton,Gosh.
4,39,John Wheaton,What are the odds that you and I would end up spending eternity together?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It is I, Tahani!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we know, babe."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I know John!
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Rather, he knows me."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,He's a gossip columnist who tortured me on Earth.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He made it seem like I was shallow, plagued with jealousy, and prone to fits of melodrama!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you saying?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't you see?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Bad Place didn't pick the worst people.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,They picked the people who would be the worst for us!
4,39,Michael,Of course.
4,39,Michael,How did I not anticipate this?
4,39,Michael,Shawn didn't just choose a bunch of serial killers.
4,39,Michael,"He chose your tormentors, or archrivals"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Or exes.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Those motherforkers!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is insane!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,And obviously against the rules!
4,39,Shawn,"Yeah, too bad it's not, dillhole."
4,39,Michael,She'll remember them!
4,39,Michael,"It's going to destroy the integrity of the experiment, Your Honor."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Plus, now I have to live next to a man who once lied and said I wasn't at Diddy's White Party!"
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was there, Eleanor!"
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was!
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,You must believe me.
4,39,Jason Mendoza,And how are we gonna make Simone better when she's asleep the whole time?
4,39,Jason Mendoza,Hello?
4,39,Jason Mendoza,We can't work with this!
4,39,Shawn,"Your Honor, you never stipulated that we couldn't choose people who had some sort of connection to them."
4,39,Shawn,"Then Simone just happened to die on Earth, which was really, really cool."
4,39,Shawn,"You wanna know how it happened, Chidi?"
4,39,Shawn,It's hilarious.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,No!
4,39,Judge,Okay.
4,39,Judge,Here's my ruling.
4,39,Judge,It's not against the rules for the four new humans to have connections to the original four.
4,39,Judge,Simone and John can stay.
4,39,Shawn,Boo-yah!
4,39,Judge,But it was kind of a dirty trick.
4,39,Judge,"So, Michael can erase Simone's memory to the point before she met any of you."
4,39,Shawn,Fine.
4,39,Shawn,"Have fun with your ex, Chidi."
4,39,Shawn,What's that thing you humans say when you're playing chess and you trap your opponent into an inescapable position?
4,39,Shawn,"Oh, right."
4,39,Shawn,"Eat butt, you dingdongs!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Focus, team!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael and I will prep for Simone.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, keep an eye on John."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Jason, talk to no one, go nowhere, do nothing."
4,39,Jason Mendoza,I won't let you down.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Go, guys."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I no!
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Very obviously no.
4,39,Michael,Look.
4,39,Michael,You could spend 100 years in this neighborhood before you even run into Simone.
4,39,Michael,It'll be easy to avoid her.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, but we don't want me to avoid her."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,The whole plan is that I'm supposed to help them learn ethics so they can improve.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can deal with that later.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's just take this step by step.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Step one, you leave so I can snap your amnesiac ex-girlfriend out of her post-death coma and welcome her into fake heaven."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,That's step one?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet?
4,39,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Give me your opinion.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is this a savage insult?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Nice shirt."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who designed it?
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Mark Fake-obs?"""
4,39,Janet,"For people in your social class, that is 84% savage."
4,39,Janet,"Although, there is a 29% chance he responds, ""Oh, honey,"" in a tone so devastating you will think of it every day for the rest of time."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I like those odds.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll go lay it on him now.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's exactly what the Bad Place wants me to do.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,They sent John here to drag me back into my old patterns.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Insecurity, obsession with social status."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I shan't let it happen.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,"John, I am happy you're here with me."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is going to be good for both of us.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I look forward to putting the past behind us and becoming your friend.
4,39,John Wheaton,"Oh, my God, you are so cute."
4,39,John Wheaton,"You are so cute, it's gross."
4,39,John Wheaton,You disgust me.
4,39,John Wheaton,I love you.
4,39,John Wheaton,Get out of here.
4,39,John Wheaton,I never want to see you again.
4,39,John Wheaton,I love you so much!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Simone."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on in.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, as a neuroscientist, are you surprised there's an afterlife?"
4,39,Simone Garnett,"I am, frankly."
4,39,Simone Garnett,"I mean, there's a decent chance this entire thing is just a complex electro-chemical reaction caused by my synapses randomly firing in the millisecond after my death."
4,39,Simone Garnett,But this fro-yo is amazing.
4,39,Simone Garnett,"So, I'm just gonna roll with it."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What flavor did you get?
4,39,Simone Garnett,I got a twist.
4,39,Simone Garnett,"Half strawberry, half ""Male Co-Worker Gets Called Out For Stealing Your Ideas""."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Those go great together.
4,39,Man,Hi.
4,39,Simone Garnett,Hi.
4,39,Simone Garnett,Wow!
4,39,Simone Garnett,All the other residents seem so nice.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The residents are great, yes."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But, uh don't feel like you need to get to know all of them right away."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe just talk to Michael and me for the first, I don't know, 6,000 years or so."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Anyway, you just chill, baby girl."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll check in with you later.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That went pretty well, right?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've always been good at pretending I've never met people before.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's kinda my go-to power move.
4,39,Michael,I think this new dynamic may actually be good.
4,39,Michael,"You know, it gives me more time to observe and plan."
4,39,Michael,"You'll be the face of the operation, and I'll be the mastermind behind the scenes."
4,39,Michael,Like Cyrano de Bergerac.
4,39,Michael,Like Kris Jenner.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Totally.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I think this is gonna be okay."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,It won't.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"It won't be okay, which is why you need to erase my memory and reboot me."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you talking about?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,No forking way!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're not rebooting you.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Shawn was right.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Bringing Simone to this neighborhood, it's checkmate."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,It completely neutralizes me.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I'll be too freaked out to help the new residents.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,The only way to outflank Shawn is to make it so I don't remember Simone.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you have to run into your ex occasionally."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's a part of life, man."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I used to run into my exes all the time.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At the mall, at the dentist's office, when I drunk texted them and told them to come over"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, Simone is really perceptive."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I might slip up and reveal something.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,This isn't just about me feeling awkward around my ex.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"It's more about if I am awkward around my ex, everyone gets tortured, forever!"
4,39,Michael,No.
4,39,Michael,There has to be another way.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've got it.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Just remove Simone from Chidi's memory, and keep everything else."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Boom!
4,39,Michael,It doesn't work that way.
4,39,Michael,You all spent a lot of time together so his memories of you and her are all swirled together.
4,39,Michael,But let's keep thinking.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Guys, I've thought about this from every angle."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"If we don't wipe my memory, I will, one way or the other, ruin the experiment."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,You know I'm right.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, man!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,It can't be.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because if we erase your memory all the way back to before you met Simone, that includes Australia, and the study, and the Soul Squad and everything!"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,That would be erasing
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Us.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the plan is to erase Chidi's memory, all the way back to when the air conditioner fell on his head, in his original timeline."
4,39,Michael,The Judge has given us until tomorrow morning before we have to bring in the other two subjects.
4,39,Michael,"Tahani, the welcome party will be tomorrow night."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"And the next time you see me, it'll be like I'm a new resident."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I won't know any of you.
4,39,Jason Mendoza,"So, will you remember that time in Australia when we stayed up late and ate pizza together?"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"No, buddy, I won't."
4,39,Jason Mendoza,Will you remember when we ordered the pizza?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,39,Jason Mendoza,Will you remember pizza?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Will I remember what pizza is?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I'll still know what pizza is.
4,39,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, so, not a total loss."
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,But this is awful.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,You two won't be together anymore.
4,39,Tahani Al-Jamil,I haven't met a more perfect couple since I set up Drake with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, we will no longer be together."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,The Bad Place has pulled off the most intricate cork-blork of all time.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hmm.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's a nice touch that the cursing filter maintains the rhyme.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I appreciate that attention to detail.
4,39,Michael,"Hang on, I'm not giving up yet."
4,39,Michael,Let's have an old-fashioned brainstorming session!
4,39,Michael,"We'll get Chinese food, and we'll throw pencils and stick them in the ceiling and someone will say something innocuous and I'll say, ""Wait say that again!"""
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Michael, if there was another choice, we'd choose it."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Believe me.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You like learning about humans, right?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is a classic human situation.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Your friends are going through something awful and there is nothing you can do about it.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Anyway, let's just rip the Band-Aid off, snappy, snappy, wipey, wipey."
4,39,Michael,I need a few minutes to work it all out.
4,39,Michael,So
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I hate this.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,And I'm sorry.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,And did I say that I hate this?
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Because I hate this.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't need to apologize for making a huge sacrifice to save your friends.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is why people love moral philosophy professors.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, how about this?"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Every time you see me get a stomachache, imagine I'm thinking of you."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, all the time?"
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Exactly.
4,39,Michael,Sorry to interrupt.
4,39,Michael,I wanted to give both of you something before we do this.
4,39,Michael,Think of it as a going away present.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't normally cry at movies.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,But that one was pretty good.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,That girl was hot.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The guy was, too."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm gonna miss you so much, Eleanor."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Except you won't.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what's so scary about this whole thing.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna miss you.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're just gonna think I'm some sexy, god-like figure, who you wanna hump immediately after meeting her."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I know you're deflecting by making jokes about how hot you are --
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's not a joke!
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm a legit snack!
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,But I believe in you.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,I am not even scared to get rebooted because I know that you'll be here taking care of me.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wish we had more time together.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,Time means nothing.
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"Jeremy Bearimy, baby."
4,39,Chidi Anagonye,"We'll just we'll get through this, and then you and I can chill out in the dot of the ""i"" forever."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll be okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We found each other before, hundreds of times."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can do it again.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bye, Chidi."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
4,39,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Janet."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Can you just, you know, like, tell me the answer?"
4,39,Janet,Sorry?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, the answer."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,To everything.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know all there is to know in the universe.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Crunch the numbers.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tell me the answer.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's the point of love if it's just gonna disappear?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,And how is it worse to not love anybody?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There has to be meaning to existence, otherwise the universe is just made of pain and I don't like the thought of that."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, tell me the answer!"
4,39,Janet,I know how you feel.
4,39,Janet,"Back on Earth, I had to watch Jason have no recognition of me."
4,39,Janet,It felt like right before someone pushes a plunger and murders you.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
4,39,Janet,"The more human I become, the less things make sense."
4,39,Janet,"But that's part of the fun, right?"
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you mean?
4,39,Janet,"If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldn't be special."
4,39,Janet,It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design.
4,39,Janet,"It would just be a big, dumb food processor."
4,39,Janet,"But, since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, it's euphoria."
4,39,Janet,"In all of this randomness, in this pandemonium, you and Chidi found each other and you had a life together."
4,39,Janet,Isn't that remarkable?
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pandemonium is from Paradise Lost.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Milton called the center of hell ""pandemonium"", meaning ""place of all demons""."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi tricked me into reading Paradise Lost by telling me Satan was, and I quote, ""my type""."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A big, mean, bald guy with a goatee."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, he wasn't wrong."
4,39,Janet,"Oh, no, that's very on-brand for you."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I guess all I can do is embrace the pandemonium.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Find happiness in the unique insanity of being here, now."
4,39,Janet,We'll do this together.
4,39,Janet,"In the words of the man that I love ""I got you, dog."""
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thanks, Janet."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, for a robot, you make a really good girlfriend."
4,39,Janet,I'm one out of three of those things.
4,39,Janet,But thank you.
4,39,Janet,Good luck.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, Chidi."
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm Eleanor.
4,39,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on in.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Wow.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"Just ""wow""."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,It's perfect.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Everything is just perfect.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"I am so, so happy!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm glad you like it.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,It's so quaint.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,It feels cozy but also vibrant and limitless.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"I can't believe how utterly, completely, 100% perfect everything is."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, let's keep this moving."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, yeah, sure."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Here is your new home, complete with two of your favorite things, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and"
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Reading lights!
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,I love reading lights.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,They're great for reading.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, oh, check this out."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, hold out your hand and think about a book."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,I can summon philosophy books like Thor's hammer.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,This is literally my number one dream.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Also ow!
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,That hurt.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I have a lot to attend to, um welcome to the Good Place, Chidi."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you so much.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, and I'm I'm sorry, this has been so overwhelming, I I forgot your name."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Eleanor.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Now I'll never forget.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, ya might!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, can we not --"
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Eleanor."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,You did a brave thing and I am embracing you.
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I shall not let you go.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,And I am also embracing you because this feels warm and my hands are cold.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, I'm good!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, it wasn't even as bad as I thought."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, who cares if he doesn't remember my name?"
4,40,Michael,Oof.
4,40,Michael,"I mean, ""cool-f""."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good save, bud."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Let's just concentrate on the next resident, who gets here in six minutes."
4,40,Michael,Wait.
4,40,Michael,I need to say something.
4,40,Michael,"I know this seems bleak, and it feels like we're all doomed, and therefore humanity is doomed."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,You needed to say that?
4,40,Michael,"The point is, I believe that we're destined to succeed."
4,40,Michael,There is nothing that the Bad Place can throw at us that we can't handle.
4,40,Michael,"Because we are an incredible, inspiring, brilliant group of --"
4,40,Shawn,Supercharged D-bag ass-wiping maniacs.
4,40,Shawn,"I mean, look at you!"
4,40,Shawn,I am so proud of how disgusting and cruel you all are.
4,40,Shawn,You suck.
4,40,Shawn,You all suck donkey butts.
4,40,Michael,"Tahani, so so smart and sophisticated."
4,40,Michael,She was the only one who was able to talk me out of that goatee.
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I lost that battle with Robert Downey Jr., and I'll be damned if I lose it with you."
4,40,Shawn,"Bambadjan, such an unbelievable dingus."
4,40,Bambadjan,Thanks.
4,40,Shawn,And Val.
4,40,Shawn,Who's a bigger skid mark than Val?
4,40,Val,Maybe your mom.
4,40,Shawn,Classic.
4,40,Michael,"We have Janet, who can do literally anything."
4,40,Michael,She made all the other people in the neighborhood.
4,40,Janet,Not people.
4,40,Michael,"We have me, who had a momentary setback, but I'm feeling great now, and that was a while ago."
4,40,Michael,"Most of you don't even remember it, probably."
4,40,Michael,"We have Jason, who can"
4,40,Michael,"And marching us into battle, our fearless leader, the pride of Phoenix, Arizona, Eleanor Shellstrop!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Technically, the Pride of Phoenix is a life-size statue of Alice Cooper made from cigarette butts."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's outside City Hall.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,But thank you for the kind words.
4,40,Michael,"With this team, there's no problem we can't solve."
4,40,Shawn,There is no problem we can't create.
4,40,Shawn,"And believe me, we are gonna create some problems."
4,40,Shawn,So let's kick things off with our official Bad Place song!
4,40,Shawn,"1 877 Kars for Kids, K-A-R-S Kars for Kids."
4,40,Glenn,"Ooh, are we singing?"
4,40,Shawn,"Shut up, Glenn."
4,40,Michael,I think you look great.
4,40,Michael,"Professional, serious, a proper team leader."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Does make me feel authoritative, like that chick from Law and Order."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Well, boys, looks like we've got ourselves an SVU."""
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've never seen the show.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who we got next?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Linda?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on in.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you, Linda Johannsen, are in the Good Place."
4,40,Linda Johansson,That's nice.
4,40,Michael,"I know this can be a little overwhelming, but you'll get used to it."
4,40,Michael,Do you have any questions?
4,40,Linda Johansson,Is there a fitness center?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There can be, plus literally anything else you could possibly wish for."
4,40,Michael,"Just in case we weren't clear, this is the Good Place."
4,40,Michael,A state of eternal happiness.
4,40,Michael,Paradise.
4,40,Linda Johansson,That's nice.
4,40,Linda Johansson,I like that.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, the Bad Place sent Simone to mess with Chidi, John to mess with Tahani do you think they sent Linda to mess with Jason?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's from Norway.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Is Norway, like, the opposite of Florida?"
4,40,Michael,All I know is she's boring.
4,40,Michael,She makes Neutral Janet look like Disco Janet.
4,40,Michael,Disco Janet was around for a while years ago.
4,40,Michael,She was great.
4,40,Michael,"I mean, she was a lot, but she was fun."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, that's a good idea."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's unload this dead weight.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
4,40,Janet,"Hi, there!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Linda, this is Janet."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you want anything at all, Janet can bring it to you."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Watch.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can I have a baby elephant made of pure light that tells you true secrets about the universe?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Anything you want from Janet?
4,40,Linda Johansson,Can I have a peppermint?
4,40,Janet,Sure!
4,40,Linda Johansson,I'm going to go over there now.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Brent, come on in."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you, Brent Norwalk, are dead."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Really?
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Well, that blows."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Uh, you know what?"
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Maybe it's a good thing, actually."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Some journalist was poking around, calling all these ladies who used to work for me."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,You can't even make a joke these days.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Everything is so PC.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"And I was an equal opportunity offender, okay?"
4,40,Brent Norwalk,I made jokes about everybody.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"And, by the way, I'm the furthest thing from racist."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,My dentist was a black woman.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,I just think people need to loosen up.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"So, where am I exactly?"
4,40,Michael,The Good Place.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, cool."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Good.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Brent, I see from your file you were in the materials business."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, yeah."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Big time.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Strings, cords, vinyl, synthetics, rubber we do vulcanized now, so that's huge."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Plus metals.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Aluminum, brass, copper."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,What else?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Steel?
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"No, not steel."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Steel's a sucker's game.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Polymers, coatings, internals you crack open an HVAC, that is all us."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Is there golf here?
4,40,Brent Norwalk,There freakin' better be.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, why don't you explore around a bit while I go far away?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And if you need anything, you can always ask Janet."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
4,40,Janet,"Hi, there!"
4,40,Janet,How can I help you?
4,40,Brent Norwalk,A secretary.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Great.
4,40,Janet,Not a secretary.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Fine, fine."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Executive assistant.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Here we go with all the ""terms"" we got to learn, right?"
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Vice President of Helping!
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Captain Marvel!
4,40,Brent Norwalk,You know what I'm saying.
4,40,Michael,"Oh, I'm not part of this."
4,40,Janet,Let me show you around.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, Linda must be here for Jason, because Brent is definitely here to annoy the fork out of me."
4,40,Michael,"Everyone, you may remember Matt from Accounting."
4,40,Michael,The Judge has assigned him to our project.
4,40,Matt,"So, I'll be monitoring the four new humans."
4,40,Matt,"A modified points system will be applied to their actions for the next year, and then we'll know how much better or worse their behavior is than when they were alive."
4,40,Matt,But no one will be able to see what's happening in real time.
4,40,Matt,Good luck saving humanity from eternal doom!
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, forget about all that stuff."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For this first week, all we need to do is figure out what the fork is up with these benches."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, I made this."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We start them out on this side, because we're like, ""What's your deal?"""
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And when we feel we have a handle on who they are, what makes them tick, we move them to this side party time!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We already know a lot about Simone, so boom!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One down, three to go."
4,40,Michael,Let's go figure out the others.
4,40,Michael,We can do this.
4,40,Michael,On three.
4,40,Michael,"""Dead eyes, eat hearts, can't lose!"""
4,40,Michael,"Sorry, old Bad Place rallying cry."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Aww!
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Janet, he's walking around again."
4,40,Janet,"Yeah, I see that."
4,40,Janet,"Derek, what are you doing here?"
4,40,Janet,You're supposed to stay at Mindy's.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I can't help it.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I'm just such a proud daddy Derek.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"I mean, will you look at all these beautiful babies that we made?"
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"She made them, dude."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,You barely did anything.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Probably just, like, made all the butts."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I did make all the butts.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"I made that butt, I made that butt."
4,40,Janet,"Mmm, right."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I made both those butts.
4,40,Janet,"Derek, you have to stay at Mindy's house."
4,40,Janet,What if one of our new humans sees you and starts asking questions about the weirdo in the tux?
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Say no more.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"But before I leave, can I have a hug in celebration of everything that we created?"
4,40,Janet,Okay.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Aww!
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,That feels so Derek.
4,40,Michael,"You were all, simply put, good people."
4,40,Michael,The point of the video is to make them all confront what kind of people they were on Earth.
4,40,Michael,Keep a close eye on our four subjects.
4,40,Michael,Try to gauge their reactions.
4,40,Michael,"The subtlest glances, the tiniest flinches"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about shaking someone by the head?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,What does that mean?
4,40,Michael,"Oh, boy."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Simone."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everything okay?
4,40,Simone Garnett,Yeah.
4,40,Simone Garnett,"Well, no."
4,40,Simone Garnett,"Well, actually, it doesn't matter."
4,40,Simone Garnett,None of this is real.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry?
4,40,Simone Garnett,"I'm a neuroscientist, so I get what's going on here."
4,40,Simone Garnett,"You know, clearly I was in some kind of horrible accident, I'm on my deathbed, and this entire thing is just a hallucination constructed by my damaged brain as it slowly shuts down."
4,40,Simone Garnett,It's not real.
4,40,Simone Garnett,"So, I'm just gonna wander around until I wake up or die."
4,40,Simone Garnett,"See ya later, figments of my imagination."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's just gonna go get some popcorn from the river.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's a popcorn river.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll show you guys later.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, she said keep going without her, so let's roll it."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, make a popcorn river."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everyone else, meet at Mindy's in ten minutes."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well we're off to a fantastic start.
4,40,Janet,"I wish I could stay and help, but this system is so complex that if I lose concentration for even one billionth of a second, the entire neighborhood could collapse in on itself like a dying star."
4,40,Janet,"Also, Brent wants a BLT."
4,40,Michael,Simone's reaction is fairly common.
4,40,Michael,"When I worked in the Bad Place, some people just wouldn't believe it when they heard they were dead."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did you convince them?
4,40,Michael,They'd usually come around by the third or fourth day of mouth fleas.
4,40,Michael,"Obviously, not an option here."
4,40,Michael,"But if Simone doesn't think this is real, she definitely won't become a better person."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,Who can convince her that this actually is the afterlife?
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We need someone authoritative and reassuring like Nelson Mandela or Sir Patrick Stewart, or, really, any of my old racquetball partners would do."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, I know who it should be."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you say Blake Bortles, I'm gonna slap you a lot."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,Chidi.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,I believe everything Chidi ever tells me because of his brain and how he looks like one of those owls that graduated from college.
4,40,Michael,Of course!
4,40,Michael,Time to activate our ethical sleeper agent and introduce him to Simone.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I don't know."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Simone isn't struggling with a philosophy problem.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She's just, you know, like being silly."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's just get her to the welcome party and I'm sure she'll be fine.
4,40,Simone Garnett,"Eleanor, look what my brain did!"
4,40,Simone Garnett,"It's not real, and neither are you."
4,40,Simone Garnett,I'm in a coma and none of this is real.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I know this is bad and we need a new approach, but she is wearing the hell out of those foam fingers."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Root-a-toot-toot.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, Janet told you to stay at Mindy's."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I know.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,I just came to mix myself a Derek and then I'll be on my way.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Before you leave, I wanna call a truce."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,All right.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"I feel like you're trying to get under my skin, but it's okay."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,I've decided to rise above it.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"Well spoken, Mr. Mendoza."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Let me say in response I will destroy you.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Janet is and always will be my mommy-girlfriend.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"You have crossed the Rubicon now, pal."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Mmm
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, status report."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,What have we learned about Linda?
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Little, I'm afraid."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I tried talking to her, but it was the dullest conversation I have ever had."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,And this is coming from someone who once split a Xanax with Peter Sarsgaard.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Frankly, I'm glad she's boring."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have enough to worry about.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,How is Brent doing?
4,40,Janet,"About the same, I'd say."
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Princeton.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,Graduated in the top half of the bottom half of my class.
4,40,Brent Norwalk,"Rowing team, sailing team, class president, I hung out with all those guys."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And John, our favorite gossip columnist?"
4,40,John Wheaton,"Luckily, before I died, I pumped my face with six vials of Juvederm."
4,40,John Wheaton,I'm hoping that my corpse looks like a waxed tile floor.
4,40,John Wheaton,My ex-boyf is gonna be supes jeal'.
4,40,John Wheaton,"Okay, well, I'm gonna do a loop trying to see who gets me."
4,40,Michael,Our biggest liability right now is Simone.
4,40,Michael,Let's try to keep the three of them away from her.
4,40,Michael,We can't wait any longer.
4,40,Michael,We have to introduce Simone to Chidi.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,I I think she's doing great.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's getting all the cake-pushing out of her system.
4,40,Michael,I know it's painful to think of the two of them connecting.
4,40,Michael,But Chidi made an incredible sacrifice.
4,40,Michael,He had his memories erased so he could help people.
4,40,Michael,"And if we don't let him help Simone, it'll be all for nothing."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fine.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Stupid ethical, reasonable argument."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wish you were a cake.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Push you over.
4,40,Michael,Are you still muttering?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I stopped."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Stupid, good-hearing, reformed demon."
4,40,Simone Garnett,Whoa!
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, there, Simone!"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Shoving people in the pool, huh?"
4,40,Simone Garnett,Yeah.
4,40,Simone Garnett,Just testing the laws of physics here in my nonsense brain-jail.
4,40,Simone Garnett,Who's this?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is Chidi Anagonye.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, so I figured he might be able to help."
4,40,Simone Garnett,Chidi Anagonye.
4,40,Simone Garnett,That sounds so familiar.
4,40,Simone Garnett,Where did you teach?
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,St. John's University in Sydney.
4,40,Simone Garnett,Of course.
4,40,Simone Garnett,I used to teach there.
4,40,Simone Garnett,I must have seen his name on the faculty list and now my dying brain is just leaking out random information.
4,40,Simone Garnett,The human mind is truly incredible.
4,40,Simone Garnett,"I want something else to get me through this semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry uh, what's what's happening now?"
4,40,Simone Garnett,"When I was a kid, my CD alarm clock broke and it used to wake me up to that song every day, so now I'm singing it to try and wake myself up."
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,40,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it was nice meeting you."
4,40,Simone Garnett,"Nice to meet you, too, cute guy generated by my rapidly-decaying temporal lobe."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,Hey --
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"You know, it's bad enough that you guys have taken over my house for a year and I've had to move into the attic, but now I have to walk in to find Darth Vader's turd in the middle of my living room."
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"I mean, what is this?"
4,40,Jason Mendoza,No time to explain.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Also, I kinda forgot."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,Where is Derek's plunger?
4,40,Jason Mendoza,The one that kills him?
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, I used to do this whenever I needed some alone time."
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"Once, I rebooted him just because he was breathing super loud."
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"Then, when he woke up, he was like ""I don't breathe."""
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,So I don't know what I heard.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Well, I'm doing this because he's trying to steal my girlfriend."
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,Yeah.
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,You don't need to justify it.
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,"Again, I do it all the time."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"No, no, no, no!"
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"Mindy, please wait."
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Don't kill me.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Oh!
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,It's you?
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Okay.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"Well, you certainly don't have the Dereks to --"
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,Yeah!
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,Oh!
4,40,Mindy St. Claire,It's always good.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know what, Simone?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Think of it this way.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If this is really all a hallucination, doesn't it seem kinda basic?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, surely your brain would imagine something weirder than just a nice cocktail party."
4,40,Simone Garnett,"Oh, you mean like that?"
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,"Attention, I have been Derek'd."
4,40,Simone Garnett,That's probably my doctor.
4,40,Simone Garnett,This is all in my head.
4,40,Simone Garnett,I'm gonna go eat a knife.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Attention.
4,40,Derek Hofstetler,Murder has been me.
4,40,Michael,Let me get this straight.
4,40,Michael,"Derek ""made mean eyes at you"", so you went to Mindy's house and murdered him?"
4,40,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, dawg, but his eyes were really mean."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,You're probably thinking this but they were more like this
4,40,Janet,"Jason, why did you kill Derek?"
4,40,Janet,"I had to get his giant head out of the sky before any of the humans could see, and it was not easy."
4,40,Jason Mendoza,I was scared Derek was trying to slide into your DMs.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,I hate being scared.
4,40,Jason Mendoza,It's scary.
4,40,Janet,I don't have time for this.
4,40,Janet,"I am running a neighborhood and its residents, and Eleanor just casually orders me to make popcorn rivers and Brent won't stop calling me for stuff."
4,40,Janet,Ugh!
4,40,Jason Mendoza,Are we still boyfriend/not-a-girlfriend?
4,40,Janet,We'll talk about it later.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Executive decision.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Forget about Simone.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, make sure she doesn't come in contact with the other humans."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's focus on Linda.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,We ought to be able to figure her out.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can just liven her up a bit.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We'll just, like, sprinkle some cocaine on her peppermints or something."
4,40,Tahani Al-Jamil,Does anyone else find it suspicious that the Bad Place sent someone so dull?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, it makes perfect sense to me."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They are trying to drive us insane by giving us a big, boring glob of plain yogurt."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tomorrow morning, we start Operation Linda."
4,40,Michael,"Okay, you heard the lady."
4,40,Michael,We'll meet in the town square bright and early.
4,40,Michael,"Janet, set up for Flying Day."
4,40,Janet,Cool.
4,40,Janet,"I'm not busy or anything, so that'll be easy."
4,40,Janet,Off you go!
4,40,Michael,Linda.
4,40,Michael,How are you enjoying the Good Place?
4,40,Linda Johansson,It's good.
4,40,Michael,Everyone's flying.
4,40,Michael,You don't want to go flying any higher?
4,40,Linda Johansson,"No, thanks."
4,40,Michael,"Well, okay."
4,40,Michael,It says in your file that you liked knitting.
4,40,Michael,Would you like to do some knitting right now?
4,40,Linda Johansson,"No, thanks."
4,40,Michael,Is there another activity you'd like to do now?
4,40,Michael,You also enjoyed listening to birds?
4,40,Michael,"Man, Linda."
4,40,Michael,You don't even look at them?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go hear some birds.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you say?
4,40,Linda Johansson,I'm gonna go get another peppermint.
4,40,Michael,No --
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, Linds."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can have literally anything that you could poss --
4,40,Michael,What the --
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,So maybe she's less boring than I thought.
4,40,Judge,"So, let me get this straight, Shawn."
4,40,Judge,You sent a demon in disguise as one of the subjects?
4,40,Michael,"Yes, he did, Your Honor."
4,40,Michael,"Luckily, none of the other test subjects saw the mess he made."
4,40,Michael,But he put the experiment at risk and he attacked me and Eleanor.
4,40,Michael,"And, I'm sorry, where's your shirt?"
4,40,Chris Baker,I think it got stuck in the skin suit.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, keep it there."
4,40,Shawn,"Damn it, Chris."
4,40,Shawn,"You were supposed to slowly undermine them and gradually sabotage the experiment, not just go ham on day two, you fart plume."
4,40,Chris Baker,"I told you, I'm not an actor."
4,40,Shawn,"And when you get back here, you won't be anything."
4,40,Shawn,"Okay, fine, yes, busted."
4,40,Shawn,I'm a rascal.
4,40,Shawn,We'll come pick him up and replace him with an actual human.
4,40,Judge,"Oh, you will do nothing of the sort, mon ami."
4,40,Judge,This outrageous act must be punished.
4,40,Judge,Chidi will be the fourth subject in this experiment.
4,40,Shawn,"No, no, no, no, no."
4,40,Judge,He's perfect because he's already had his memories erased.
4,40,Judge,Although you can't erase that booty.
4,40,Judge,"Know what I'm sayin', blondie?"
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All due respect, Your Honor, keep it in your robe."
4,40,Michael,"What she means is, ""Thank you, Your Honor, we accept."""
4,40,Michael,Chidi's gonna be our fourth subject.
4,40,Shawn,Chidi can't be part of the experiment.
4,40,Shawn,They already know that he can improve.
4,40,Shawn,That's like studying for a test then acing the test.
4,40,Shawn,It's cheating.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,How is that cheating?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're just falsely accusing us of what you actually did.
4,40,Shawn,"No, that's what you're doing."
4,40,Judge,"Shawn, I don't have time for this."
4,40,Judge,"I just started Deadwood, finally, and I need my daily dose of Timothy Olyphant, so I'm gonna make this short."
4,40,Judge,"If you so much as breathe on this experiment again, I will restart the entire thing from scratch, and then I will personally rip off your eyelids and make you watch heartwarming videos of soldiers coming home to their dogs."
4,40,Michael,Whoa!
4,40,Michael,Slow down.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did you put those trash cans there just so you could crash into them?
4,40,Bad Janet,That wasn't my fault.
4,40,Bad Janet,I was texting.
4,40,Bad Janet,"Okay, let him go, dung buckets."
4,40,Michael,Nice try.
4,40,Michael,We'll put him on the train and handcuff him to a bench.
4,40,Janet,Come on.
4,40,Michael,"Yeah, forgive us if we don't trust you not to cheat again."
4,40,Bad Janet,"Surprised you figured out that Linda was a fake, because we all thought you were too stupid."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, it was actually Tahani who got suspicious."
4,40,Bad Janet,Oh!
4,40,Bad Janet,That is so embarrassing for you.
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,Seems like you're royally forking this up just like we knew you would.
4,40,Michael,Okay.
4,40,Michael,Take off.
4,40,Michael,And give Shawn a message for me.
4,40,Michael,"Tell him that we said, ""Booyah!"""
4,40,Michael,"Make sure you do the hand motion, like, ""Booyah!"""
4,40,Michael,Are you listening to me?
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, Michael --"
4,40,Michael,"No, show me how you're gonna do it."
4,40,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's fine.
4,40,Michael,"No, it's important that she does the hand thing because it really drives the point home."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I still don't get why the Bad Place would try something so obvious?
4,41,Michael,They're desperate.
4,41,Michael,They know they're gonna lose.
4,41,Michael,"Plus, we can get rid of the Linda picture, and put a Chidi picture on the other side since we know a ton about him."
4,41,Michael,"It's all good news, right, team leader?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, it's super cool that I'm actively surveilling and manipulating an ex-boyfriend."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, more so than I usually did."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, let's focus on Brent."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Born on third base, thinks he invented the game of baseball."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys like this believe that the world revolves around them, because it kinda does."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If we could get him to listen to anyone else, he'd hear how much better they are than he was, which might make him realize that he doesn't belong here, and also, bonus maybe he cries like a stupid little baby."
4,41,Wanda,"Anyway, long story short, that's why there are still ducks."
4,41,Wanda,I saved all the ducks.
4,41,Audience,Aw!
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Incredible.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thank you, Wanda."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,What a life.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now we turn to our next guest, Chidi Anagonye."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, Chidi, you led an impressive life as an academic."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, well, uh, not save-an-entire-species impressive, but yes, I was a professor of ethical and moral philosophy."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Literally every duck?
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,You saved every duck?
4,41,Wanda,"In essence, yes."
4,41,Wanda,"And I didn't mention this before, I really don't like to brag, but also horses."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Man.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, compared to you, I feel a little inadequate."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Hey.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?"
4,41,Jason Mendoza,I feel bad for making Janet's life more chaotic and unpredictable.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"So, here's my idea to make it up to her."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Me and 100 Janet babies do a giant flash mob, just total unpredictable chaos all around her."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Great idea, right?"
4,41,Michael,"Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Mmm-hmm?
4,41,Michael,"Sorry, I put a little cheat code in the neighborhood, where if I say your name five times, my headache goes away."
4,41,Michael,Do you know why I forced you to act like a monk in the original neighborhood?
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Does it have to do with the TV show Monk?
4,41,Michael,No.
4,41,Michael,It's because you have no control over your own impulses.
4,41,Michael,"You think every problem can be solved with a Molotov cocktail, or slashing somebody's tires or plunging Derek."
4,41,Michael,"So, being a monk was torture for you."
4,41,Michael,The only way for you to repair your relationship with Janet is to give her some space.
4,41,Michael,Show her that you can control your impulses.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"So, you're saying wanting to do something isn't a good reason to immediately do it?"
4,41,Michael,Yeah.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Man!
4,41,Jason Mendoza,I wish someone had taught me this on Earth.
4,41,Michael,People tried.
4,41,Michael,Mostly judges.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hey, showtime."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And now, Brent Norwalk, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Thank you very much.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Thank you.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Sure.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I'm pretty interesting.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I grew up in Chicago.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"A suburb, obviously."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I went to Princeton University.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"No handouts, by the way."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I earned my spot there.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Just like my father and his father before him.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I then inherited the family business, and in just 18 years, I grew Norwalk Materials from a $90 million company to a $94 million company."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,One second.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, Janet?"
4,41,Bad Janet,"Hi, there."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Perrier.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't you tell us about a time when things didn't come so easy to you?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Mmm.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Look, I've had my share of disappointments."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I smartly bought Netflix stock at $38 a share, but I couldn't cash it in before I died."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"So, all that money's going to my dumb kid."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"But you have to press on, right?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., who I personally believe was a great man, he said that, ""When life knocks you on your butt, you jump back up and start throwing haymakers."""
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not sure he said that.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"No, he did."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,You're wrong.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"For me, Eleanor, it's all about taking personal responsibility."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Not enough people do that.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"If you ask me, that's what's wrong with this country."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,What country?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"This was fun, Eleanor, but I have a tee time."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"So, Chad, Duck Lady, nice to meet ya."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Thank you.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Thank you all very much.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,You were great.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,A car?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,He got a car?
4,41,Michael,Okay.
4,41,Michael,"Well, back to the drawing board."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If we want him to understand he doesn't belong here, we don't need a drawing board."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to bust him open like a pinata.
4,41,Michael,We tried that in the Bad Place.
4,41,Michael,The goo that comes out doesn't taste as good as candy.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, dude, metaphorically."
4,41,Michael,Ah.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Although, there is another Bad Place strategy that might work very well here."
4,41,Michael,I don't know if that's the right move.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's our only move.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,And we're doing it tomorrow.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"What the hey, Janet?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Janet!
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Is that Perrier?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Michael!
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Eleanor!
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Brent, I'm so sorry."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't know why all of this is happening.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Well, I do."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,This chaos is clearly all about me.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,This is the universe telling me that I don't belong here.
4,41,Michael,"Brent, what do you mean?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I don't belong in the Good Place.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, obviously, there's a place better than this."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I belong there, in the Best Place."
4,41,Michael,"Walk me through this, Brent."
4,41,Michael,I'm not sure we follow.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Well, I've been feeling this way for a while now."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, this can't be all the afterlife has to offer, not to the cream of the crop."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, if this is heaven, then where are my guys?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Where's Scotty and Schultzy and Porcupine?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Where's White Guillermo, and where is Mexican William and what about Squirtman?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, he makes a good point."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about Squirtman?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Also, frankly, my assistant Janet is a little uptight."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts."
4,41,Michael,"Have you been asking Janet to make herself clothes, that you give back to her?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you're doing the math right there, bud."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Look, this chaos, which is clearly all about me, is a sign."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"If this is the Good Place, I belong in the Best Place."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"So, figure it out, get back to me."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Okay?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna go punch a wall with my head.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll meet up with you later.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, I'm afraid we need to talk about Eleanor."
4,41,Michael,I know what you're gonna say.
4,41,Michael,She's just been really busy.
4,41,Michael,I'm sure she'll get around to showering at some point.
4,41,Bad Janet,"No, it's not that."
4,41,Bad Janet,"Although, it's not, not that."
4,41,Bad Janet,It's possible we need a new team leader.
4,41,Michael,"Oh, really?"
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,We just can't help but question her decision-making.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,She balked at bringing Chidi and Simone together.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,She ignored my concerns about Linda.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,Her plans for Brent backfired.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,We've made precious little progress.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope, but she keeps screwing everything up."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,That's my thing.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,And you wouldn't put me in charge.
4,41,Michael,"Actually, that's a decent point."
4,41,Michael,But think about what you're saying here.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,We have.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,We should at least discuss pursuing a change in leadership.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, hey, Eleanor."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,We were just talking about how maybe you shouldn't be team leader.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Saved it.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Go ahead, guys."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Speak your mind.
4,41,Bad Janet,"It isn't personal, Eleanor."
4,41,Bad Janet,"When we started this experiment, I calculated a 9% chance of success."
4,41,Bad Janet,"After your first three days on the job, it's down to 7.1%."
4,41,Bad Janet,"So purely from a mathematical standpoint, you are kind of pooching it."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very helpful feedback.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And if I could give you some feedback, uh, I'd say that you're all ungrateful ash-faces, who can shove your fat grumps all the way up your snork-box."
4,41,Michael,Which curses were those?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't ask for this.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm only doing it because Michael, who is supposed to be in charge, had a nervous breakdown the second it started."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,But maybe you can do it better than me.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani can be in charge since she's so smart.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or better yet, Jason."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe all of humanity can be saved with one good, old-fashioned Jacksonville carnival."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, we could try."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"All I need is a bouncy house, some ninja stars and a bunch of ambulances."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, good luck, fork-faces."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I quit.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shellstrop out.
4,41,Michael,You get it all out of your system?
4,41,Michael,"You gonna come back, get to work?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, man, I meant what I said."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I quit.
4,41,Michael,"I'm sorry you overheard that, and they're sorry they said it."
4,41,Michael,"But you don't just get to quit this, Eleanor."
4,41,Michael,"This is not your seventh-grade band, or three hours into a two-week juice cleanse."
4,41,Michael,A little more at stake here.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,The things that are happening here are above my pay grade.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do I get Brent to stop being such a deckhead?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,How do I fix Simone when she's convinced all of this is happening inside of her brain?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ooh, maybe I should drive her into the arms of my ex-boyfriend?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sounds fun.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What do I do about John, the gossip king, or the demon spy who punched me in the face?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,And how do I do it all with a pleasant smile to keep everyone's spirits up?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not meant for this.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not the freakin' savior of the universe.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just a girl from Arizona.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's it.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I ate junk food, I watched reality shows, I sometimes left H&M wearing more underpants than I had on when I came in."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I did a bad job of being in charge of my own life, and now I'm supposed to be in charge of everyone else's life?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I I cannot do this.
4,41,Michael,"When I started my experiment, I thought, ""Four broken birdbrains who will believe everything I tell them."
4,41,Michael,"This will be a breeze."""
4,41,Michael,You beat me in three months.
4,41,Michael,"""Okay, fine,"" I thought, ""a fluke."""
4,41,Michael,You then beat me 800 more times.
4,41,Michael,"Because human beings, it turns out, are weird, and I will never truly understand what it's like to be one."
4,41,Michael,This is a job for a human.
4,41,Michael,"One who's tough, but also empathetic and has a big heart, and a world-class bullshirt detector."
4,41,Michael,You think you can't do this?
4,41,Michael,"Eleanor, you're the only one who can do this."
4,41,Michael,"Like it or not, the only one who can save humanity is a girl from Arizona."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,But everything I do blows up in my face.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote."
4,41,Michael,That's true.
4,41,Michael,"About you making lots of mistakes, not the thing where you sexualized a cartoon."
4,41,Michael,"Come on, you know how this works."
4,41,Michael,"You fail, and then you try something else, and you fail again and again."
4,41,Michael,"And you fail 1,000 times, and you keep trying, because maybe the 1,001st idea might work."
4,41,Michael,"Now, I'm gonna go and try to find our 1,001st idea."
4,41,Michael,I hope you'll join me.
4,41,Michael,I hope you shower first and then join me.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ladies and gentlemen, back with her trademark brand of B-minus leadership, Eleanor Shellstrop."
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor."
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,We never should've questioned you.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Don't worry about it, hot stuff."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was questioning me, too."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But I'm back, baby."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I have a new idea for Brent.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guys like him never think they're wrong.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we're gonna tell him he's right."
4,41,Michael,Brent?
4,41,Michael,This conversation must remain confidential.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Okay.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Obviously, you're a very smart guy."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Yes.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we need to know that we can trust you with sensitive information.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,You can.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I routinely buried HR complaints.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"So, no problem."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The truth is, Brent, you figured us out."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,There is a Best Place.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I knew it!
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I knew it.
4,41,Michael,"The Best Place is reserved for a select, upper echelon of good people."
4,41,Michael,Sort of like a Diamond Elite VIP club of afterlife residents.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I was Diamond Elite.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I swear.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"One time, I did shots with this pilot in the lounge."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,The guy let me fly his helicopter.
4,41,Michael,We know.
4,41,Michael,That's how you died.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Right.
4,41,Michael,"So, you'll all be evaluated, and then a very small group of the most morally upstanding residents get to go."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, I see."
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"So, it's like a ""good deeds"" contest?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,That's easy.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,I'm gonna crush this.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, and hey, mum's the word, right?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Why tip off my competition?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Oops!
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Looks like you dropped your fork.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Let me get that for you.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Did you get that?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,The fork thing?
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Or should I start writing these down?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you're good."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll keep track.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Great.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Love it.
4,41,Bad Janet,"Hi, Jason."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Janet.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,I'm so happy to see you.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,I got you a box of chocolates.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"But then I remembered you can't eat, so I ate them, and I thought it'd be a nice present for me to describe them to you."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"So, the first one was gross --"
4,41,Bad Janet,"Jason, um, please just let me talk."
4,41,Bad Janet,You know that I've been overwhelmed with work since the neighborhood started.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Yup.
4,41,Bad Janet,And I asked you to give me some space.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Yup.
4,41,Bad Janet,I'm so sorry to say this but I can't be in a relationship with you right now.
4,41,Bad Janet,"Being with you is fun, but it's not always easy, and I'm afraid it would endanger the experiment."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,It won't though.
4,41,Bad Janet,"Jason, it already has."
4,41,Bad Janet,"So, why don't we just take a break until it's all finished?"
4,41,Bad Janet,"Also, I hate to pile on, but I feel like you have a right to know."
4,41,Bad Janet,The Jacksonville Jaguars cut Blake Bortles.
4,41,Bad Janet,He's not on the team anymore.
4,41,Bad Janet,I am genuinely sorry.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,"Hi, how are you?"
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Nice to see you.
4,41,Brent Norwalk,Enjoy your yogurt.
4,41,Michael,"Problem is, now he's saddled with a bad motivation."
4,41,Michael,His points won't go up if the only reason he's being nice is to make his points go up.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,But that was also my situation when I first asked Chidi for help.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We have to hope that over time, Brent starts doing good things out of habit."
4,41,Michael,Just like you.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, I just realized something."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That whole ""You're the only one who can save us"" speech."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You didn't actually have a nervous breakdown on day one, did you?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You faked it, so that I would step up and take over."
4,41,Michael,Guilty.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,You tricky devil.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very clever.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Time to go help Simone and Chidi.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oof!
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why did I come up with this idea?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is gonna hurt real bad.
4,41,Michael,I know.
4,41,Michael,I know.
4,41,Michael,But I think it's gonna work.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sure there's no other girl from Arizona who can do this?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,What about Emma Stone?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's from there.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's very capable.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Remember her in Zombieland?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,And La La Land?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What's with all her movies ending with ""land""?"
4,41,Michael,You're stalling.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yup.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Heading out.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Jason, I'm so sorry."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,Janet was my whole afterlife.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,How am I gonna get over her?
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,I used to have a breakup routine when a relationship ended.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,Champagne and Alanis Morissette.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not the actual singer.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just listened to her albums at my friend Adele's house.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,I guess I could do my normal breakup routine.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"Drink a ton of Mountain Dew, steal an ATV and ride it through a Panda Express."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,"But then I'd have to ask Janet for the Mountain Dew and the ATV, and then I'd have to see Janet, and then I'd start crying."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,What do I do?
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,I honestly don't know.
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But whatever you do, you'll be doing it with your friends."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,And I didn't even get to tell you about the Blake Bortles part.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, Chidi, do you remember that woman Simone from the party the other night?"
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Simone... the Third Eye Blind superfan who walked around cutting off people's ponytails?
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's the one.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I need your help, acclimating her to the neighborhood."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've tried, but since she thinks this whole thing is imaginary, and I'm an authority figure, I'm extra suspicious."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, what makes you think I'd have any more luck?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, you and Simone are soulmates."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Soulmates?
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Like our souls are are
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Mates, yes."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everyone has people that they're cosmically bound to, and the system brings them together in the afterlife."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I can say, with complete certainty, that you and Simone are two such people."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I haven't told her yet.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I wouldn't have told you, ordinarily, but since she's gone a little cuckoo bananas that's the official architect term."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I thought it was prudent to let you know."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Whoo, boy, uh I'm getting a stomachache."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,But a good one!
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,A happy stomachache!
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,This is new.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,There are some great writings on simulated realities that might help her adjust.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou I wonder if I can summon a book from my apartment."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, good luck."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,This is incredible.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"I spent my whole life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe, but I never actually fell in love with someone."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, right."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Of course.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,You know everything about me.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,I do indeed.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Hi, Simone."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, Chidi."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,From the other night.
4,41,Simone Garnett,Oh!
4,41,Simone Garnett,Wow.
4,41,Simone Garnett,My brain must really like keeping you around.
4,41,Simone Garnett,Have a fake seat and grab a yogurt that doesn't exist.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Right, um so, if I understand your state of mind, it's basically solipsism."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"You think that you're the only real thing in the universe, and everything else stems from your consciousness."
4,41,Simone Garnett,"Yes, but to be fair, I only think that because it's true and I'm right."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"No offense, but solipsism, as a philosophy, is pretty juvenile, especially for a person with multiple advanced degrees."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"And it's also impossible to refute, because everything you see is confirmed by your belief."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,However
4,41,Simone Garnett,Dude!
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, if none of this is real, then it really shouldn't matter, right?"
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,In fact
4,41,Simone Garnett,Dude!
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,It's not real.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,None of this matters.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,Leave that on your nose for the rest of time.
4,41,Simone Garnett,Fine.
4,41,Simone Garnett,Point sort of taken.
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, in a larger sense, if you go around acting like no one else matters, then you end up doing things like knocking over cakes, and pushing people into pools and just generally acting like a jerk."
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"Why not treat them better, just in case they're real?"
4,41,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, what do you have to lose by treating people with kindness and respect?"
4,41,Simone Garnett,Okay.
4,41,Simone Garnett,"Keep talking, probably-fake but-maybe-real philosopher man."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, good news, Simone and Chidi are hitting it off."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I wasn't getting any use out of him as a boyfriend, so why not pass him off to someone in need?"
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is this what donating old bras to Goodwill feels like?
4,41,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It must have been really hard, lying to Chidi like that."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's the thing, I don't know that it was a lie."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,They did fall in love on Earth.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,And Michael was right.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us, and I had to make sure it was worth it."
4,41,Michael,It's arguable that you made an even bigger sacrifice.
4,41,Michael,You actually have to live with this situation.
4,41,Michael,"Chidi gets to go around, blissfully unaware of what he gave up."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, but we know what he gave up."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dat ash.
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, bud."
4,41,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know you're down, but you can't leave me hanging."
4,41,Jason Mendoza,You're right.
4,41,Jason Mendoza,That is the code.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, what's on tap for today?"
4,42,Michael,Chidi's study group should be off and running.
4,42,Michael,We can go check in on how Brent's doing.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If there's anyone that can turn that ashhole into a good person, it's Chidi."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,My man used to collect action figures of famous philosophers.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Ooh, Eleanor, look, it's a near-mint Arthur Schopenhauer, with a working quill!"""
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,What a dork.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love him so much.
4,42,Michael,Chidi might make the new humans better all on his own.
4,42,Michael,It's so great he erased his memory.
4,42,Michael,"But, you know, it's also quite sad, for you, in a way that I always think about, and am respectful of."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Hi, Eleanor."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Hi, Michael."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,We were just heading off for a picnic.
4,42,Michael,Oh!
4,42,Michael,"You know, we were actually just gonna go check in on your new student, Brent."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, you know, I'm not sure that Brent's in it for the long haul."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"He came to one session, and then he said he got a B-plus in Moral Values at Princeton, and so maybe he should be the professor."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Then he asked me if I knew that he went to Princeton.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I said I did.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Then he said he went to Princeton, and he left."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, just for argument's sake, what would Kant say about your duty to help your fellow human beings?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, honestly, when the weather is this perfect, I think that Kant would say, ""Who's up for some frisbee golf?"""
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Guys, you gotta hear this joke I made about Kant."
4,42,Michael,Never seen Chidi like that.
4,42,Michael,"He was chillaxing, which is a word I just invented combining ""Chidi"" and ""relaxing""."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I guess once you have the burden of saving humanity removed from your brain, life is dandy."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Must be nice, Chidi."
4,42,Michael,That's what's missing.
4,42,Michael,Chidi isn't being tortured.
4,42,Michael,"As far as he's concerned, he did everything right on Earth, so now he just gets to enjoy himself."
4,42,Michael,"If we don't force Chidi into stressful decision-making, he won't even have the chance to become a better person."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you wanna make a pearl, you gotta get some sand in your clam."
4,42,Michael,Oyster.
4,42,Michael,We need Chidi to live in a world of low-grade dread.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I've got this.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I have a ton of experience making ex-boyfriends' lives miserable.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First up, we fill his acoustic guitar with wet cat food."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Judge me all you want, I get results."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Janet, darling?"
4,42,Bad Janet,"Hi, there."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ooh!
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,You dyed your hair?
4,42,Bad Janet,I did.
4,42,Bad Janet,"After I broke up with Jason, I researched how humans cope with relationships ending, and number eight on the list was doing something dumb with your hair."
4,42,Bad Janet,"Number 42 was watch Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, so I did that, too."
4,42,Bad Janet,It was okay.
4,42,Bad Janet,It's just a lot of the same songs as the first one.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, hopefully ""diving back into work"" was also high on that list, because we need to help John and I know how."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Spa day.
4,42,Bad Janet,"""Spa day""?"
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That's right, Janet."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've cracked the code.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"See, in 2014, John wrote 11 articles mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation at an exclusive resort in Bali."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But then he researched cheap flights to Bali for himself, and looked into something called a ""discount hotel package""?"
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"See, John's pettiness was the result of feeling excluded by the rich and powerful."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, I, the rich and powerful, am going to welcome him into an exclusive world of luxury and pampering."
4,42,Bad Janet,"Oh, he loves celebrity gossip."
4,42,Bad Janet,You should tell him about how eight different characters from Game of Thrones are based on you.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,That is a great idea.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,See?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're getting it now.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"First, we open his pores and then we open his heart."
4,42,Bad Janet,"We exfoliate the dead skin cells of envy, and we detoxify his soul."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Spa day.
4,42,Bad Janet,Spa day.
4,42,John Wheaton,I'm so excited for spa day!
4,42,John Wheaton,"I mean, I know I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight, and the air is obviously perfect, and no one has any jobs, or stress or problems, but I just feel like I need this."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, you are in for a treat, 'cause I had Janet build an exact replica of Victoria Beckham's ultra-exclusive private spa."
4,42,John Wheaton,Posh's spa?
4,42,John Wheaton,The Posh Wash?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's the most coveted invitation in England.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Membership is based on weight and net worth.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Gain a pound or lose a pound and you're out.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Shall we go?
4,42,Michael,"Jason, there you are."
4,42,Michael,We need your help.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, hand me the jar."
4,42,Michael,What?
4,42,Jason Mendoza,The peanut butter jar.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Give it.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,You said you needed help opening a peanut butter jar.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, we didn't."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Oh.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Then who said that?
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shut up and listen.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need your help with something very important.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Are you sure?
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I'm probably just gonna mess it up like I messed things up with Janet.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, helping to save humanity is as good a way as any to get over a breakup."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, it's not like Janet has a car you can key, or a house you can ""Left Eye Lopes""."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, I'm in."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"I got your back, guys."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Now, hand me that jar."
4,42,Michael,Are you speaking metaphorically?
4,42,Michael,"Like, the task we're embarking on is a metaphorical jar you're gonna open by accomplishing the task?"
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
4,42,John Wheaton,"Oh, goodie, cucumber water."
4,42,Bad Janet,"Nope, this is fresh water from Oprah's estate in Maui, with mushrooms from her private bog in the Pyrenees mountains."
4,42,John Wheaton,"Oh, my God, it takes like candy."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You know what they say, ""A mushroom from Oprah's bog is better than anything from anywhere else."""
4,42,John Wheaton,"Ugh, I didn't know that they said that."
4,42,John Wheaton,I missed out on all the cool celebrity sayings.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Say goodbye to FOMO.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,You can finally experience the best of the best.
4,42,John Wheaton,The only thing that would make this any better is some hot goss.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Very well.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Our story begins when I ran into Robbie Williams, Heidi Klum, and the remaining members of Fifth Harmony at the Dolce & Gabbana spring show."
4,42,John Wheaton,"Hate him, loathe her, over them, cancel it, tell me everything."
4,42,John Wheaton,So Natalie Portman does all of Scarlett Johansson's stunts?
4,42,John Wheaton,Why?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,For the power.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just to say she can.
4,42,John Wheaton,Sure.
4,42,John Wheaton,I get that.
4,42,John Wheaton,"Oh, Tahani, I feel amazing."
4,42,John Wheaton,Thank you.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're quite welcome.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hey, you know what would give you an even more luminous glow?"
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"There was this sort of inner treatment that was all the rage on Earth, the study of ethics."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Think of it as a colonic, but for your soul."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Our resident philosopher, Chidi Anagonye, leads an ethics study group in his apartment."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,What do you say you and I sit in?
4,42,John Wheaton,Would I like to use my time in heaven to audit a philosophy class?
4,42,John Wheaton,Um no.
4,42,John Wheaton,"You stay crazy, girl."
4,42,John Wheaton,Bye.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, how was the picnic?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, amazing."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, there were ants everywhere, but they were so helpful."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,They carried our wine glasses back and forth and they folded our napkins for us.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,It was so cute.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wait till you see the otters who do our turndown service.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, you might know Jianyu, the monk?"
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,He wants to join your philosophy study group.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, sure, we can get that up and running again."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe discuss some Lao Tzu and Confucius.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Fun!
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Everything is so fun.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Perfect.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, just one thing."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, he's been having kind of a hard time adjusting here."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Apparently, monks aren't the most social creatures."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, just promise me you'll help him no matter what?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, I swear to you, I will look after Jianyu as if he is my own brother."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, a promise from a strict Kantian like yourself is just about the most ironclad agreement in the universe."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, buh-bye."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Bye.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Jianyu, would you like some --"
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, shut up for a sec."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I'm not a Buddhist monk.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"My name is Jason Mendoza, I'm a DJ from Florida, and I'm not supposed to be here."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"You gotta help me out, homie."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I'm scared.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Tea.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I was gonna offer you some tea.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, thanks to you, my dream came true."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I have a shiny new budhole.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"You okay, homie?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I've had a stomachache for a week.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,There have been way too many close calls.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Please, I beg you, no more meatball subs, no more drawing boobs in the dirt."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I cannot lie to cover for you.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Please, remember, you're supposed to be a monk."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor and Michael are here.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,What a fun surprise.
4,42,Michael,You've done some re-decorating.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh!
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yes, my apartment was decorated in one way and now it has been redecorated."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,And how is Jianyu?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you know how monks are."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Calm.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Peaceful.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Never, you know shotgunning Cheez Whiz."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, what monk would do that?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No monk!
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Anyway I see you guys are still here.
4,42,Michael,We were just dropping by to ask a favor.
4,42,Michael,Can you accompany Jianyu to the luau tonight?
4,42,Michael,He still isn't really engaging with the neighborhood.
4,42,Michael,We're hoping you could help him break out of his shell.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, I don't think I can make it."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, why not?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"I just remembered I can make it, so I will see you there."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Bye.
4,42,Bad Janet,I don't understand why John hasn't made more progress.
4,42,Bad Janet,You've done so much to make him feel special.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I know.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I recreated the private tour of the Louvre where they let you touch all the art.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,We rode Aquamans through the water.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I got so many beauty treatments, I fear my hair may be too shiny and lustrous."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We've been getting on quite well, but every time I bring up self-improvement, he just shuts me down."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I haven't encountered this much resistance since I tried to get Timothee Chalamet to go out into the sun.
4,42,Bad Janet,"You know, I looked at John's files again."
4,42,Bad Janet,He was hardly a shrinking violet.
4,42,Bad Janet,"If you think he needs help, maybe you should just tell him directly."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps you're right.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I shall go on the attack, just like six of the eight Game of Thrones characters who were based on me would do."
4,42,Bad Janet,Yeah.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, how are things going with Chidi?"
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Super easy.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,All I have to do is be myself and he's constantly freaking out.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You have that effect on people, bud."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,What else can we do to mess up his life?
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Mmm, listen, E-Dog, I know people don't look to me for plans, or ideas, or anything, but maybe we should ease off."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,He's pretty stressed already.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Please.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not even dry-heaving yet.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,How many Tums did he take today?
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Like, 20."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's nothing.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't stop until it's the whole bottle.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because the more miserable he is, the more he's going to teach you, and then everyone, and then he'll save humanity."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's like Superman with nervous diarrhea.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get ready.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna make that speech soon.
4,42,John Wheaton,"Hey, girl."
4,42,John Wheaton,Wanna hit up the spa tomorrow?
4,42,John Wheaton,"I wanna try that new Little Mermaid treatment, the one where they remove your vocal chords and it somehow makes your legs look amazing."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Perhaps, but I was hoping to bend your ear on a more serious matter."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The things you used to write, frankly were hurtful."
4,42,John Wheaton,What?
4,42,John Wheaton,Name one.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I gained five pounds and you called me ""Ta-Hammy All-The-Meals""."
4,42,John Wheaton,"I mean, that's just poetry."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, you were so mean to Daniel Day-Lewis he quit acting."
4,42,John Wheaton,"Oh, I'm sorry, was he ""living in character"" as a man who thought he could pull off boot-cut jeans?"
4,42,John Wheaton,You know what?
4,42,John Wheaton,I see what this is.
4,42,John Wheaton,This has been a fake friendship.
4,42,John Wheaton,This whole week has just been a wind-up to a sucker punch.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, it hasn't."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just want you to recognize that your blog hurt people and you have a chance to be better here.
4,42,John Wheaton,B'scuse me?
4,42,John Wheaton,You're telling me to be better?
4,42,John Wheaton,"While you were gallivanting around with your fancy friends, I lived in the real world, so I had bills to pay."
4,42,John Wheaton,"I worked 16 hours a day, by myself, building a site with millions of readers."
4,42,John Wheaton,"You're the one with issues, sweetheart."
4,42,John Wheaton,"If ya spot it, ya got it."
4,42,John Wheaton,Whoosh!
4,42,John Wheaton,That's another deuce for the Gossip Toilet.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hello and welcome.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is everyone having fun tonight?
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have an exciting activity planned for all of you.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have all been given a magic lava stone.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When you throw them into the bonfire, you will receive whatever your soul most desires."
4,42,Michael,"Step right up, Matilda."
4,42,Michael,Give it a toss.
4,42,Matilda,"My childhood pet, Shell Turtlestein."
4,42,Matilda,Hi.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I wanna do that.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No!
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"You cannot, under any circumstances, do that."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, but I gotta do that."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"If you throw that stone, your truest, actual desire will appear, and who knows what that is?"
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I do.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,My old motorcycle with Pamela Anderson airbrushed on the side.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"It exploded a week after I got it, because someone wanted to see what would happen if they poured lighter fluid in the engine."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Was that someone you?
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Yep.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Turns out it explodes.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,Called it.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Look, maybe Jianyu the monk likes motorcycles."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,We don't know his life.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No monk's truest desire is a motorcycle with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, it wasn't her face."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
4,42,Michael,A sexually explicit motorcycle?
4,42,Michael,Whose rock was that?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Yay!
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,It's mine.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Jianyu tossed my rock, uh, because he wanted to help me, his friend, who loves motorcycles and Canadian TV actress, Pamela Anderson."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Thanks, Jianyu."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"And now, I will ride it away."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Can't wait to cruise the streets in this bad boy.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, man."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Now we're cooking with gas.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, this was a huge success."
4,42,Michael,Chidi's an absolute mess.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, we should pop open some champagne."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Call those magic ants.
4,42,Michael,He's clearly being tested like never before.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, and now we need to ramp up the pressure."
4,42,Michael,"Eleanor, he told an outright lie."
4,42,Michael,We don't want him so freaked out that he can't help anyone else.
4,42,Michael,I think we did enough for the day.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No way, dude."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can't stop now.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to push him to the edge.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to knead his fragile psyche until he's hyperventilating and losing his mind.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Guys um hey, can we talk?"
4,42,Michael,Yeah.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I need to tell you a secret.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I I can't.
4,42,Michael,"No, no, no."
4,42,Michael,"Guys, guys, not now."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I spent my whole life on Earth battling a stomachache because I never knew what to do.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"And for a while here, that was gone, but recently, I've been miserable."
4,42,Michael,"Why, Chidi?"
4,42,Michael,You're in the Good Place.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"I know, but I have this problem."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,And if I choose Option A but if I choose option B no.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, Chidi, sometimes adversity can lead to growth."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever the moral dilemma is, maybe you'll come out on the other side better for it."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I'm I'm used to moral dilemmas.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I like moral dilemmas.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,They're my jam.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,But this just feels like I'm
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Like I'm being punished somehow.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"And, obviously, I know that's silly."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,This is the Good Place.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,You two would never do anything to hurt anyone.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"But I am seriously worried that I did something wrong, and this is the universe getting back at me."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, wait, what's what's happening now?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I I made God cry?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, stomachache."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Welcome back, old friend."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, I can't believe John."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,The man who once started a protracted Twitter feud with Jacob Tremblay thinks that I'm the one with issues?
4,42,Bad Janet,Ugh.
4,42,Bad Janet,Maybe you need to be even more direct with him.
4,42,Bad Janet,"Like, punch him in the face."
4,42,Bad Janet,I don't know.
4,42,Bad Janet,I'm fired up.
4,42,Bad Janet,You've just been very nice to him and I don't like the way he's treating you.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Maybe it's not possible.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,We're just too different.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He spent his life in the bowels of the Internet, jealous and miserable, with no real friends, while I spent my life in the upper echelon of society jealous and miserable with no real friends."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, Janet."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've been going about this all wrong.
4,42,Bad Janet,Exactly.
4,42,Bad Janet,Here you go.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, uh no."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Why are you crying?
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is all my fault.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I promised I'd take care of you, Chidi."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,You did?
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I promised.
4,42,Michael,"Uh, see, Chidi, the architect is responsible for the entire neighborhood, so a resident suffering in any way, it's very painful for her."
4,42,Michael,"Actually, come here, come here."
4,42,Michael,But don't worry.
4,42,Michael,We have a very simple solution for problems here.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, good."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,What is it?
4,42,Michael,We eliminate them.
4,42,Michael,"So, you just tell us the problem, and we'll eliminate it."
4,42,Michael,"Like, uh say you had a problem with that vase."
4,42,Michael,See?
4,42,Michael,"So, just tell me what's bothering you, I'll wave my hand, it'll explode, and you can go back to your otherwise perfect life."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Uh the motorcycle.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Yup, that's my problem."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"For some reason, it just hasn't been bringing me as much happiness as maybe it was intended to, so I'd just as soon get rid of it."
4,42,Michael,Done.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, not again."
4,42,Michael,No more motorcycle.
4,42,Michael,Problem solved.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better."
4,42,Michael,"No, no, she'll be fine."
4,42,Michael,She'll be fine.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,John?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I have something to say.
4,42,John Wheaton,Round two?
4,42,John Wheaton,Let's do this.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In 2007, Blake Lively invited me to a birthday party held for Leonardo DiCaprio aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht."
4,42,John Wheaton,"Hmm, I see we're dropping names three at a time now."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The guest list was 100 of the wealthiest, most famous members of the glitterati."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Once aboard, I discovered there was a VIP deck."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And within that area, there was an even more exclusive room that you could only access with a secret PIN, which I promptly entered."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,And guess who was waiting for me?
4,42,John Wheaton,"Ah, I hate to admit it, but I have to know."
4,42,John Wheaton,Who?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,No one.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I was the only one there.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The party raged on outside, but I was so obsessed with status that I never left."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I spent the entire night talking to no one.
4,42,John Wheaton,Riveting story.
4,42,John Wheaton,If only it were longer and sadder.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The point is, if all you care about in the world is the velvet rope, you will always be unhappy, no matter which side you're on."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,You and I are proof of that.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,But now we're here.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can we just start over?
4,42,John Wheaton,"Well if we're gonna be friends, I need to say something."
4,42,John Wheaton,I really am sorry for all the posts I wrote about you.
4,42,John Wheaton,And everything I tweeted.
4,42,John Wheaton,"And scrawled on the back of a Playbill during the intermission of Wicked, and had someone pass it to you and say it was from an anonymous, concerned citizen."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was you?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, my bangs were ""making my ears look chunky""."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was a fair hit.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's a lovely night.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Would you like to go for a walk?
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, Jason?"
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,New plan.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Instead of just trying not to get caught, we're going to study ethics."
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,I'm going to help you become a good person.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dope."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,I always wanna get better.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,That's why I spent so much of my time at the free clinic.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,"Hang on, just editing my syllabus in my head based on that comment."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,This is gonna be awesome.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,You rule.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,You're like the Pam Anderson boob-motorcycle of people.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,That's an amazing compliment.
4,42,Chidi Anagonye,And I'm sorry your actual motorcycle blew up.
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, well, that's okay, homie."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,That's just what motorcycles do.
4,42,Michael,"So, Chidi's set with Jason now."
4,42,Michael,How are you doing?
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,A little better but still terrible.
4,42,Michael,You were torturing him because that's what we had to do.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,I went too far.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And what's worse, I liked it."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because I'm angry at him for leaving me, which isn't even remotely fair, because he sacrificed himself for us, but I'm still angry he abandoned me, which makes me feel guilty, which makes me angry, which makes me want to talk to Chidi, because he's the person I go to when I'm angry."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, it's a real fun cycle."
4,42,Michael,I still don't have a grip on the human emotional spectrum.
4,42,Michael,"You guys are often happy when you should be sad, and angry when you should be happy, and texting when you should be driving, which is not an emotion, I know, but it's insane."
4,42,Michael,"The point is, in this case, even if it's not rational, you're allowed to feel a little angry."
4,42,Michael,Let yourself off the hook.
4,42,Michael,Process it and work your way through it.
4,42,Michael,"And then get your shirt together, because we have a lot of work to do."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Morning, all."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Anyone interested in a status report?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I win!
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I mean, I'll start."
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,I have made massive progress with John.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is he gonna join Chidi's class?
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Philosophy may not be his way forward.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,Genuine human connection shall be his course of study.
4,42,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And first up on the syllabus, he and I will be unironically watching the Britney Spears movie Crossroads together and you'll have to trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction."
4,42,Michael,"Wonderful work, Tahani."
4,42,Michael,"And, Jason, I mean, bravo."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"Thanks, guys."
4,42,Jason Mendoza,"It's been a tough couple weeks, and it just felt really good to be brainy, and have use-ness."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sure, bud."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I think we can finally say that all four of these mofos are on the right path."
4,42,Eleanor Shellstrop,So what's next?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thirty seconds left.
4,43,Michael,Come on.
4,43,John Wheaton,"Oh, oh!"
4,43,John Wheaton,It's a butterfly.
4,43,John Wheaton,"Uh, it's Mariah Carey's lower back butterfly tattoo."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
4,43,Michael,"Well done, John."
4,43,Michael,"And because you guessed correctly, watch what happens."
4,43,John Wheaton,Oh!
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
4,43,John Wheaton,I should've gotten that sooner.
4,43,John Wheaton,I wrote my college thesis on that back tattoo.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, because remember, every picture from tonight will have something to do with your lives on Earth, so you can get to know each other a little bit better."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, blue team, you're up."
4,43,Brent Norwalk,"Go get 'em, Chippy."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chidi, it's your turn!"
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm a pretty decent artist, but I'm not so great under pressure."
4,43,Bad Janet,Your time begins now.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, boy."
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Uh
4,43,Simone Garnett,"You got this, Chidi."
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure out how to start"
4,43,Brent Norwalk,"Come on, just start drawing, my brotha."
4,43,Simone Garnett,"Oh, no."
4,43,Simone Garnett,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
4,43,Simone Garnett,No.
4,43,Bad Janet,Thirty seconds.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, here we go."
4,43,Simone Garnett,Oh.
4,43,Simone Garnett,Uh it's a submarine?
4,43,Brent Norwalk,Looks like broccoli with teeth.
4,43,Simone Garnett,"Oh, oh!"
4,43,Simone Garnett,It's it's a horse with a bow on its neck.
4,43,Simone Garnett,"Oh, is it my childhood pony, Daisy?"
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Yes!
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no."
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,No!
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,What have I done?
4,43,Brent Norwalk,"You made a frickin' Frankenstein, man."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oka, okay, you know what?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Magic Pictionary is over now, so let's all go home and get some sleep."
4,43,Brent Norwalk,You guys want me to kill it?
4,43,Brent Norwalk,I've shot a lot of racehorses.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fork me.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was a disaster.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,How did that go so wrong?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Well, for one thing, Brent got super wasted."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,We should have cut him off.
4,43,Bad Janet,Nobody gets cut off in the Good Place.
4,43,Bad Janet,"If he asks for beer, I give him a beer."
4,43,Bad Janet,I'm just glad he stopped asking me to go to dinner so we could discuss my career.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, we haven't done a successful activity in, like, three weeks."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're ice cold.
4,43,Michael,"Guys, give yourself a break."
4,43,Michael,They're getting better.
4,43,Michael,"Brent's stopped saying ""Daddy like"" all the time."
4,43,Michael,That's something.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Something feels off.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, we need new ideas."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I say we hole up here for an all-night brainstorming session.
4,43,Michael,"Now, just hang on."
4,43,Michael,We're working really hard.
4,43,Michael,And we need to relax occasionally or we're gonna burn out.
4,43,Michael,"So, let's just, you know, clear our brain, watch a movie or oh!"
4,43,Michael,We'll have a slumber party.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
4,43,Michael,"Whoever you are, show yourself!"
4,43,Glenn,Oh.
4,43,Glenn,"Hold on, the hood is caught in my glasses."
4,43,Glenn,Hi!
4,43,Glenn,I'm Glenn from the Bad Place.
4,43,Michael,What are you doing here?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, what do you want, creep?"
4,43,Glenn,"No one knows I'm here, and I have some important information."
4,43,Glenn,"Eleanor, I need to speak with you alone."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever you need to say to me, you can say right here."
4,43,Glenn,I don't think I should.
4,43,Glenn,It would lead to a very uncomfortable social situation.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Say it.
4,43,Glenn,That's not Michael.
4,43,Glenn,"That's Vicky the demon, in a Michael suit, and she's sabotaging your experiment."
4,43,Glenn,You see?
4,43,Glenn,It's uncomfortable.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, just sit there quietly until we sort all this out."
4,43,Glenn,"If it's not too much trouble, could I get a hot glass of pig urine?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to talk.
4,43,Glenn,Or I'm not picky.
4,43,Glenn,Whatever urine you have is fine.
4,43,Michael,"Eleanor, you have to believe me."
4,43,Michael,I'm Michael.
4,43,Michael,He's lying.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Calm down, dude."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I trust you.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I'm gonna make Glenn think I don't trust you.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Somehow, this has to be related to the problems we've been having here, and we need to figure out what game they're playing."
4,43,Michael,"Oh, that's good."
4,43,Michael,"I like the way you think, Shellstrop."
4,43,Michael,"I mean I hate the way you think, Shellstrop."
4,43,Michael,Is he buying it?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's not looking.
4,43,Glenn,"I'll tell you whatever you wanna know, but shouldn't we call the Judge?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're not calling anyone until we figure some things out.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have questions.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, for example, if you're a devil, how come you're not wearing Prada?"
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Caramel!
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why would you help us?
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"One day, you're flattening penises and the next, you just decide to defect?"
4,43,Glenn,"Actually, one of my jobs was to reinflate the penises, so they could get flattened again."
4,43,Glenn,It doesn't matter.
4,43,Glenn,"Listen, I loved torturing humans because I thought they deserved it."
4,43,Glenn,They said everyone in the Bad Place was evil and beyond repair.
4,43,Glenn,I don't know if I believe that anymore.
4,43,Glenn,"Also, Shawn is so mean, you guys."
4,43,Glenn,He yells at me all the time.
4,43,Glenn,"It's, like, unnecessary."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"I feel you, dawg."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I was yelled at my whole life.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"People were always like, ""You didn't pay for that."""
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"""How do you plead?"""
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"""He's flatlining."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Clear!"""
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, if that's Vicky, what's the Bad Place's plan?"
4,43,Glenn,"To sow chaos, turn you guys against each other, ruin the experiment."
4,43,Glenn,"Also, I have proof that's not Michael."
4,43,Glenn,Here are pictures of Vicky wearing the Michael suit.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,This doesn't prove anything.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,These could just be pictures of the real Michael.
4,43,Glenn,They're real.
4,43,Glenn,"I know, because I helped make the suit."
4,43,Glenn,"We couldn't figure out how to make it contain your demon essence, so you'll have to wear it over the Vicky suit."
4,43,Shawn,Ugh.
4,43,Shawn,Really?
4,43,Shawn,"You're the worst, Glenn."
4,43,Shawn,Let's do it.
4,43,Shawn,Zip her up.
4,43,Vicky,"Okay, but if I melt, I am gonna be, like, so annoyed."
4,43,Vicky,Oh.
4,43,Vicky,Pretty well-made.
4,43,Vicky,I can really feel all the musty skin folds and the... the dangly bits.
4,43,Michael,The voice is perfect.
4,43,Michael,You sound so much like him I wanna punch you.
4,43,Glenn,Are we sure it's okay that we made this?
4,43,Glenn,"I mean, what are you gonna use it for?"
4,43,Shawn,"""What are you gonna use it"""
4,43,Shawn,"Shut up, Glenn!"
4,43,Shawn,The experiment is about to begin.
4,43,Shawn,"Let's call the real Michael and send him spiraling down the toilet bowl, like the pinched turd he is."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, now we know you're lying, because Michael would have definitely told us if the Bad Place had called him and showed him some freakin' Michael suit."
4,43,Michael,Absolutely.
4,43,Michael,Of course I would've.
4,43,Glenn,"I mean, Janet would have phone records."
4,43,Glenn,You can just ask her to pull them up.
4,43,Michael,"Okay, fine, I lied."
4,43,Michael,They called me.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,43,Michael,I lied about that and I'm sorry.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,You knew about this?
4,43,Michael,"Yes, yes, but there's a good explanation."
4,43,Glenn,"Yeah, the explanation is that's Vicky, and she's lying to you about everything."
4,43,Glenn,Call the Judge and we'll settle this once and for all.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Or is that exactly what you want us to do?
4,43,Glenn,That is what I want you to do.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Exactly.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, perhaps we should call the Judge."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Glenn was telling the truth.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, the Judge said if anything else went wrong, she would reset the whole experiment."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We are not calling her unless we have no other choice, and I am locking you two jamokes in separate rooms until we get to the bottom of this."
4,43,Michael,Ah!
4,43,Michael,I'm very upset about this development.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm serious, man."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is happening.
4,43,Michael,Oh.
4,43,Michael,I'm very upset about this development.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, buttheads, what do we do?"
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I say we trust Michael.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,He's our friend.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, he might be our friend."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or he might be a lying trickster who just looks like our friend.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,The classic Mary Kate Olsen.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I have to say, we've had a lot of misfires recently, and Michael has been acting suspiciously."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, tonight, when I wanted to work, and he just wanted to have a slumber party instead."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"To be fair to Mike, slumber parties rule."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,And why would we trust Glenn?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,He's a demon.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,So's Michael.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Demons can be good.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Right.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, so it's decided."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,We trust both of them.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, predictably, this was unhelpful."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get in there.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is all this stuff?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are these weapons?
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Ooh!
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Don't touch those.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Those are my special magnet handcuffs.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,They make me feel silly when Mindy and I are playing Upstairs-Downstairs Derek.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, they're sex toys."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're sex toys!
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, get out of here."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,We have enough problems.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,"My good man, allow me to bury the hatchet."
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Being rebooted again has evolved me past any feelings of jealousy.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Ho-ho!
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,I know that sound.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Looks like someone found my sex diaper.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,I'll leave you guys alone to live that dipe-life.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, explain yourself."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,If your self even is yourself.
4,43,Michael,I am Michael.
4,43,Michael,"Shawn did call me, and I saw the Michael suit."
4,43,Michael,"He said if the experiment failed, he was going to use it to make you think I was torturing you."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Why didn't you tell us?
4,43,Michael,"Because he said he would just erase your memories of me telling you, so it wouldn't matter anyway."
4,43,Michael,He knew that I would crumble under the pressure.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But a month ago, you told me you only pretended to freak out, in order to get me to step up and become a leader."
4,43,Michael,Yes.
4,43,Michael,"That also was a lie, but it was an inspirational one, like ""So great running into you."
4,43,Michael,"We should get coffee sometime,"" or all of Instagram."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, to recap: you found out the Bad Place made a Michael suit, freaked out, didn't tell us why."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,And then later you lied to me about why you freaked out.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,And then you lied again just a few minutes ago when you said that you never got a call from Shawn.
4,43,Michael,"Yes, but that lie was only to cover my two earlier lies."
4,43,Michael,"I mean, that's gotta be okay, right?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,43,Michael,"Eleanor, don't you see what they're doing?"
4,43,Michael,"Shawn sent Glenn to undermine our trust in each other, so you'll call the Judge and restart the experiment."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I have no reason not to believe you."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Other than the three very recent examples we just laid out.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Huddle.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,Oh!
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,"Hey, sorry."
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,I just needed to grab this.
4,43,Derek Hofstetler,"You know, it's chime time."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's gotta be a way to figure out if that's the real Michael.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a way you can make some sort of demon lie detector?
4,43,Bad Janet,Oof.
4,43,Bad Janet,I don't know.
4,43,Bad Janet,"The Janet babies are still draining me, and I just had to put down Daisy the horse-blob, which was exhausting, emotionally and physically."
4,43,Bad Janet,She fought back.
4,43,Bad Janet,I won't get into details.
4,43,Bad Janet,I had to twist her head off.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Sorry, no more details."
4,43,Bad Janet,She did thrash.
4,43,Bad Janet,She thrashed.
4,43,Bad Janet,Sorry.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't we just get him drunk so he starts blabbing?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, what goes best with pig urine?"
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Coconut rum.
4,43,Bad Janet,That won't work on a demon.
4,43,Bad Janet,I'll try and make a lie detector.
4,43,Michael,"Oh, no, damn it!"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's going on in there?
4,43,Michael,I touched the dang diaper!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get back in that room.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,So Michael saw the suit.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Big deal.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I still think you're forking with us.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think this is just like when the Bad Place sent us Linda, who turned out to be some super-jacked punching guy, and just like him, you got busted."
4,43,Glenn,That's the thing.
4,43,Glenn,The puncher didn't get busted.
4,43,Glenn,It worked exactly as planned.
4,43,Glenn,The whole thing was a diversion to get real Michael out and sneak the impostor in on a train.
4,43,Glenn,It must've happened during the handoff.
4,43,Glenn,"While Janet was handcuffing Chris, a bunch of demons must've grabbed Michael, yanked him away, and then Vicky, in the Michael suit, walked back out."
4,43,Glenn,You never would have known the difference.
4,43,Glenn,"Also, when Chris got back, I saw Shawn and him celebrating."
4,43,Glenn,Why would they be happy if he wasn't supposed to get caught?
4,43,Shawn,"Man, I love a good sabotage."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Or is that exactly what you want us to think?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Motherforker.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew there was something weird about that puncher.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I said that to Michael and he dismissed it.
4,43,Glenn,See what I mean?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't go anywhere.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If Michael is just Vicky in a Michael suit, let's just take the suit off."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, maybe we can sneak up behind him and try and pants him from the forehead."
4,43,Bad Janet,That won't work.
4,43,Bad Janet,"A demon can take his own skin suit off, but no one else can."
4,43,Bad Janet,It's like a very complicated bra.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, so be it."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Take off your skin suit.
4,43,Michael,I can't.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sure, you can."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're either a demon wearing a Michael suit, or you're demon wearing a Vicky suit, who's wearing a Michael suit over that."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just take off your Michael suit and show us what you're working with.
4,43,Michael,"I'm sorry, I won't."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's very suspicious.
4,43,Michael,I know.
4,43,Michael,But I'm not Vicky.
4,43,Michael,I just don't want to show you what's underneath here.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I've seen a lot of weird hogs in my life, dude."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Get over yourself.
4,43,Michael,That's not it.
4,43,Michael,I'm a fire squid.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Dope.
4,43,Michael,"No, not dope."
4,43,Michael,"I'm a 6,000-foot tall fire squid."
4,43,Michael,I have tentacles.
4,43,Michael,There's teeth everywhere.
4,43,Michael,"I'm on fire, and my neck is long, and there's a smell and lots of juice."
4,43,Michael,"There's so much juice, Eleanor."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I think I speak for everyone here when I say I really have to see this.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you're not gonna take off your demon Spanx because you're shy?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's convenient.
4,43,Michael,"Eleanor, if I take off this suit, I will crash through the roof, and the entire neighborhood will see me, and the experiment will be blown."
4,43,Michael,But it's more than that.
4,43,Michael,You guys will never look at me the same way again.
4,43,Michael,I won't just be Michael.
4,43,Michael,I'll be some disgusting mass of burning tentacles.
4,43,Michael,Do you really wanna be friends with something like that?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I keep saying.
4,43,Bad Janet,Eleanor.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Now, I don't know if this will work, but, theoretically, if you point it at a demon and he's lying, it'll turn red."
4,43,Bad Janet,"If he's telling the truth, it'll turn green."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Glenn, this is a lie detector."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let us show you how it works.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's your name?
4,43,Glenn,"Well, everyone calls me Glenn, but the name on my demon certificate is actually Snakes Pour Forth From His --"
4,43,Bad Janet,Glenn blew up.
4,43,Bad Janet,Glenn blew up.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Or is that exactly what he wants us to think?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"So, does blowing up mean he was telling the truth or lying?"
4,43,Bad Janet,Neither.
4,43,Bad Janet,That was not supposed to happen.
4,43,Bad Janet,I've never killed anybody before.
4,43,Michael,"No, don't worry, demons can't die."
4,43,Michael,"He'll slowly re-form himself over a few months, passing through all the stages of demon growth: larva, slug monster, spooky little girl, teenage boy, giant ball of tongues, social media CEO, and then finally, demon."
4,43,Michael,"So, look at the bright side."
4,43,Michael,This worked out perfectly.
4,43,Michael,"I mean, not for Glenn, obviously, but for us."
4,43,Michael,The lying demon's gone.
4,43,Michael,We're still here.
4,43,Michael,All good.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're not ""all good"", man."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're either Michael and you lied, or you're Vicky in a Michael suit."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nobody go anywhere.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I didn't think anyone would still be up.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you okay?
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yeah, yeah."
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, I'm just practicing drawing viable horses."
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"Ones that aren't crimes, you know, against nature."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I know this mood of yours."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,From reading your file and whatnot.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, why don't you take a break and we'll get some food in you?"
4,43,Bad Janet,"Well, I'm done."
4,43,Bad Janet,I scooped it all up into one steaming pile of Glenn.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Maybe I can put him back together.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I'm hella good at puzzles.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"I finished this word search in, like, 30 seconds."
4,43,Bad Janet,"Jason, I feel terrible."
4,43,Bad Janet,"I know he was a demon, and he may have lied to us, but he didn't deserve that."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,You were only trying to help us.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Look, I know this is a weird time, but if you ever wanna talk, just know that I'm here for you, girl."
4,43,Bad Janet,"Thanks, Jason."
4,43,Bad Janet,That means a lot.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I gotta say, out of all the ""human stuff"" I've been able to experience in this neighborhood, nachos?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Number one.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Easy.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Really?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, salty, crunchy, cheesy, little bit of a kick."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Name one better thing humans have created.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,The Sistine Chapel?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pfft!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Paint on a ceiling.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, it's fine, but can you eat it at the movies?"
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Touche.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, don't stay up all night drawing horses."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's really fine.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,I know.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,"I just feel like I made the world a little bit worse, and I won't be okay until I make it better again."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Making yourself miserable to ease the suffering of others.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,About the most Chidi thing you can do.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll see you later.
4,43,Chidi Anagonye,Do you wanna take the rest of those nachos with you?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I do, thank you."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, here's where I'm at."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I just don't know if I can ever trust you.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna call the Judge.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll start over.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We won't have Chidi in the mix, but he'll be on our side again, which is almost as good."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,But we know the humans now.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Starting over sounds exhausting.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But if that's not Michael, he could sabotage us in ways we can't even perceive."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And even if it is, I can't fully trust him, so every time something goes wrong, a little part of me is gonna wonder."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have to start over.
4,43,Michael,I have a better idea.
4,43,Michael,I'm gonna blow myself up.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,What?
4,43,Michael,I'll blow myself up.
4,43,Michael,"That way, you can continue the experiment with Chidi as one of the people, which is our best chance to ever be successful."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Why not just lock you in a room, or in Janet's void or something?"
4,43,Michael,But then you might worry that I'd escape.
4,43,Michael,"If I blow myself up, I'm out of your hair for good."
4,43,Michael,"Well, parts of me will be in your actual hair, but you get it."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Michael, wait --"
4,43,Michael,"Tahani, this is the only way."
4,43,Michael,There's literally nothing I can say that will make you realize that I'm really me.
4,43,Michael,"Oh, boy."
4,43,Michael,This is gonna suck.
4,43,Michael,"Hopefully, I will see you all in a few months."
4,43,Michael,Good luck.
4,43,Michael,"Oh, and make sure that you, uh, get all of me into the container, or I might come back, uh, way shorter, and that would bum me out."
4,43,Michael,"I wish I were saying this in different circumstances, but take it sleazy."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Michael, wait!"
4,43,Bad Janet,"Oh, crud-nuts!"
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, how did you know that was Bad Janet?"
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Michael said there's nothing he could say that would make you realize he's really him.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,But Janet does have a thing she can say that does make me realize she is really not her.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"I called Janet ""girl"", but she didn't say ""not a girl""."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"The real Janet always says ""not a girl""."
4,43,Michael,"Oh, wow."
4,43,Michael,That realization's the only thing that stopped me from becoming a pile of goo.
4,43,Michael,Ugh.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ugh!
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, how did you pull it off?"
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,You were outside on the platform with me the whole time.
4,43,Bad Janet,"We brought two Bad Janets on the train, you dumb, dumb idiot."
4,43,Bad Janet,The other one distracted you on the platform while Good Janet brought Chris on to the train.
4,43,Bad Janet,"I snuck out, marbleized Janet and then I took over, baby."
4,43,Bad Janet,Stupid Michael never knew.
4,43,Bad Janet,I had you fart-knockers fooled for weeks.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Until Glenn, the traitor, ruined everything."
4,43,Bad Janet,"That guy sucks, right?"
4,43,Bad Janet,"Shut up, Glenn."
4,43,Michael,"Wait, wait, wait."
4,43,Michael,Bad Janets can't impersonate Good Janets.
4,43,Michael,I've seen them try.
4,43,Michael,"Their heads melt, so"
4,43,Bad Janet,Oh.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Oh, you're so smart, sir."
4,43,Bad Janet,"Well, listen, here's the thing."
4,43,Bad Janet,Shawn rebooted me like 40 million tines.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Wait, tine-mis."
4,43,Bad Janet,Timeses.
4,43,Bad Janet,These things rule.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip, this means Janet didn't dump me."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Her weird sister did!
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,Everything makes so much more sense.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,All of Janet's ideas were so counterproductive.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,She brought the horse monster to life.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,She forced me to antagonize John.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,She got us to doubt Eleanor's leadership skills.
4,43,Bad Janet,"Oh, I was just about to launch an idea where Tahani was gonna give herself an asymmetrical haircut."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,You monster.
4,43,Bad Janet,Thank you.
4,43,Michael,"Guys, we still have a problem here."
4,43,Michael,You still don't have evidence that I'm actually me.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sure, we do."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,You offered to sacrifice yourself to help a bunch of cockroaches.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's about the most Michael thing you can do.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Where's real Janet?
4,43,Bad Janet,"Oh, she's in the Bad Place."
4,43,Bad Janet,She's probably wiping her butt with her own butt.
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I can't bear the idea of poor Janet down there, all alone."
4,43,Tahani Al-Jamil,What should we do?
4,43,Jason Mendoza,I know what to do.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,It's like what that guy who blew up said Shawn's a bully.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,And sometimes the only thing a bully understands is a punch in the mouth.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"I'm gonna go down there, I'm gonna punch him in the mouth and I'm gonna get Janet back."
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wow, sounds like somebody has a plan."
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Dope.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, where is he?"
4,43,Jason Mendoza,What's the plan?
4,43,Michael,It's okay.
4,43,Michael,You sure you can hold down the fort?
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not at all.
4,43,Eleanor Shellstrop,You sure you can do your thing?
4,43,Michael,Nope.
4,43,Michael,"We'll just try our best, right?"
4,43,Michael,Okay.
4,43,Michael,Let's go get our girl.
4,43,Jason Mendoza,Not a girl.
4,44,Vicky,"Oh, Janet, you disappoint me."
4,44,Vicky,I expected more of a fight from you.
4,44,Vicky,"Yet here you are, all alone in the Bad Place, rendered powerless by a measly magnet jail."
4,44,Janet,"It's okay, I guess."
4,44,Vicky,"What is the issue now, hmm?"
4,44,Janet,That's not how Michael laughs.
4,44,Janet,It's more of a delighted giggle.
4,44,Shawn,She's right.
4,44,Shawn,You need to nail his subtleties and mannerisms for this to properly work as torture.
4,44,Vicky,My problem with the role is that I haven't fully figured out Michael's motivation yet.
4,44,Vicky,"Like, I'm inside Michael, but I need to be ""inside"" Michael."
4,44,Janet,Hmm.
4,44,Janet,"You know, it actually feels more like torture when you discuss your ""acting process""."
4,44,Vicky,You don't get it.
4,44,Janet,"If you really wanna know Michael's motivation, it's the same as the rest of my friends: loyalty, empathy and love."
4,44,Vicky,Ew.
4,44,Janet,And that's why they will prevail.
4,44,Vicky,"I hate to break it to you, hon."
4,44,Vicky,They're not gonna prevail.
4,44,Vicky,No one's coming to save you.
4,44,Janet,Oof.
4,44,Janet,Getting colder.
4,44,Vicky,I know!
4,44,Vicky,I could feel it.
4,44,Vicky,"You know, it was wrong."
4,44,Vicky,I'm just I'm in my head now.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, Mikey, I have a question about our plan to save Janet."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Is there it yet?
4,44,Michael,"I do have a plan, yes."
4,44,Michael,"But to be honest, I have no idea if it will work."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Maybe Glenn can help.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Yo, Glenn!"
4,44,Jason Mendoza,How should we rescue Janet?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,He doesn't know.
4,44,Michael,"Listen, Jason, old friend."
4,44,Michael,I already gave Eleanor and Tahani all their afterlife memories back.
4,44,Michael,I haven't restored yours for obvious reasons.
4,44,Michael,"But I think to maximize our chances of survival, it's time that you remember everything we've been through."
4,44,Michael,"Prepare yourself, this might be intense."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Oh dip!
4,44,Michael,Do you remember everything?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Last time I was in the Bad Place, I threw a Molotov cocktail."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,That was sick.
4,44,Michael,I was afraid that you'd watch 300 years of memories and that would be your takeaway.
4,44,Michael,"Buddy, I did that to help you know what not to do."
4,44,Michael,Impulse control is critical.
4,44,Michael,"Fight the urge to blow stuff up, even if you feel like we're in a jam."
4,44,Michael,Got it?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, that's very lame, but, yeah, I understand."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Wait, can I have all my memories back again?"
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I forgot most of them.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Welcome, everyone!"
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet will be unavailable for a bit.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's undergoing some routine system maintenance.
4,44,John Wheaton,"Oh, I know what that means."
4,44,John Wheaton,"Eye lift, maybe an ear tuck."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm!
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When we don't have Janet, we like to refresh your memories of your old lives, when you did things for yourselves."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,We call it Earth Day!
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, yes, we know that's a thing on Earth, but what are they gonna do, sue us?"
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, get ready for some fun, lo-fi activities."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,This group over here is gonna knit.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You folks are gonna do your favorite activity, gardening."
4,44,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, man, we better get something better than that."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And you five are going to a gorgeous, remote lake house."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Swimming, waterskiing, the works."
4,44,Brent Norwalk,"Suck it, gardeners."
4,44,Simone Garnett,Why do I feel like that's not the first time he's screamed those words?
4,44,Bad Janet,Ugh.
4,44,Bad Janet,"Get me down from here, you tiny butthole."
4,44,Bad Janet,Ow!
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Thank you for keeping me safe from my sexy, bad-girl sister-aunt."
4,44,Bad Janet,Ew.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,I know that I've caused you a lot of trouble in the past classic Derek.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"But from now on, I'm here to help."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'd feel a lot more confident if you weren't holding a champagne glass full of Scrabble letters, but you're all we got."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You can keep the neighborhood running, right?"
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Well, I wasn't technically designed for this, but to be fair, I wasn't designed for anything."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, we're gonna get the humans far away from the center of town to help lighten your load."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,That would be really great.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Okay.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, babe, it's go time."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You ready?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Absolutely.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I feel very confident with you in charge.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"In the words of my godfather, acting in what can only be described in hindsight as his most problematic role ""You the man now, dawg."""
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"As always, thank you for finding the quickest possible way to say things."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, head off to the lake house, and do your fabulous Tahani hostess thing!"
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Actually, uh, now that you bring it up, Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet and you're running things here."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Even Derek has an important job.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Ah.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'd like to be more useful.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,What is it that you Americans say?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh ""Insert me, coach man!"""
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Put me in, coach."""
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Babe, we need these humans to stay happy and occupied."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So just pump 'em full of champagne, and those tiny little sandwiches and keep 'em dazzled."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Though I'd never serve finger sandwiches at a lake house.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I mean, what am I, Welsh?"
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,I don't know.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, right?"
4,44,Michael,Okay.
4,44,Michael,We have to move quietly.
4,44,Michael,We can't be seen by anyone until we get to Shawn.
4,44,Michael,It's the only way to rescue Janet.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, Michael?"
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I'm scared.
4,44,Michael,"Me, too, bud."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, what if all this time apart has changed me and Janet's relationship?"
4,44,Jason Mendoza,What if that special connection is gone?
4,44,Michael,Yeah.
4,44,Michael,"I mean, for me, it's scary that we're standing in the birthplace of evil, surrounded by billions of demons who wanna destroy us."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Hmm.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I guess we both have things we're scared about.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, all."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I took the liberty of preparing a few simple snacks.
4,44,John Wheaton,Ooh!
4,44,John Wheaton,This place is nice.
4,44,John Wheaton,Did anyone else see that movie The Lake House with Keanu and Sandy B?
4,44,John Wheaton,"Ugh, I love a movie with gentle magic."
4,44,John Wheaton,"Give me a time-traveling mailbox, or a mother-daughter body switch, or, like, Sarah Michelle Gellar as a chef and her food tastes amazing because she cries in it."
4,44,John Wheaton,I should have been a screenwriter.
4,44,Brent Norwalk,Yeah.
4,44,Brent Norwalk,"This'll do, I guess."
4,44,Brent Norwalk,I got dibs on the master bedroom.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Um, Simone?"
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Where's Chidi?
4,44,Simone Garnett,He decided to just stay at home and read.
4,44,Simone Garnett,He said swimming in lakes scares him.
4,44,Simone Garnett,"To be fair, most things scare him."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, never fear."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You all stay and enjoy the full-sized sandwiches.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I shall go and fetch Chidi.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Tahani is on the job.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Perv 'stache, four eyes bee monster."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Whoa!
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Is that you?
4,44,Michael,"Technically, yes."
4,44,Michael,But it's a version of me I no longer recognize.
4,44,Michael,"Behind that handsome smile was so much cruelty, so much pain inflicted on so many, with such glee."
4,44,Michael,Shameful.
4,44,Michael,What echoes of this former self await me here?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I feel you.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,It was always hard for me to go back to my old high school.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,So many memories.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Also, the junkyard machine crushed it into tiny cubes."
4,44,Michael,"If we get out of here alive, remind me to re-erase your teen years."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, guys."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hurry back.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Wanda."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everything okay?
4,44,Wanda,Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come again?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,44,Wanda,Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Derek?
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Oh!
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Hey!
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"So, uh things are not going well."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You said you could handle this.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Yeah, well, it turns out being a single father to 300 kids is not that easy, Eleanor."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, the four humans are still at the lake house, so we can figure this out."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you doing here?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I came to get Chidi.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,He decided to stay home.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi's up there?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right now?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Chidi, there you are."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, I should've told you."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,I decided to just stay home and read.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Swimming in lakes scares me, and so does waterskiing --"
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We know all that, Chidi."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,We never expected you to meet the group at the lake house.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,We had a special solo activity planned for you.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Really?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm-hmm.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,What is it?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have hidden several clues in this apartment to a puzzle.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Ooh!
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,I love puzzles.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"They're so much fun, but they're also like homework."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Win-win.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, this one's a doozy because when you solve it, you get the answer to the truth about the universe."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Spoiler alert I guess.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful, but everyone's back at the lake house with no party hostess, which is obviously less than ideal."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, go on, get."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Of course.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Good luck, Chidi."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"So, what's my first clue?"
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've already gotten it.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Ooh!
4,44,Shawn,"All right, idiots."
4,44,Shawn,"This is hour 52 of the 4,000-hour presentation on the future of torture."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?"
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Here's what I think.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,We should throw a Molotov --
4,44,Michael,Jason.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,What?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I didn't say cocktail.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I could've meant Molotov anything.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,You don't know.
4,44,Michael,Just trust me.
4,44,Michael,I have a plan.
4,44,Shawn,Humans are worse than every.
4,44,Shawn,We have to innovate.
4,44,Shawn,"Sure, poking sticks work great, but should those sticks be sharper or hotter?"
4,44,Shawn,Should they counter-intuitively be less hot?
4,44,Shawn,"Let's begin with slide number one of 7,000."
4,44,Michael,Nice speech not!
4,44,Michael,"What's up, dingus?"
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, no."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, that's not good."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, what are you guys oh, no."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Don't do that.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,That's not Derek.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Derek.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm going back to the lake house to entertain, because, apparently, that's all I'm good for."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Okay.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm gonna need some party supplies.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Cocktail napkins with a cute, lake-related slogan."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Maybe they could say ""better lake than never""."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Oh, sorry, I've just got nothing left in the tank."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Derek, when you get rebooted, you become more advanced right?"
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Yeah.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, perhaps then you'd be more capable of controlling the neighborhood."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Hey, yeah, yeah."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You said you wanted to make this up to us.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, now is your chance."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Yes.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Derek.
4,44,Shawn,"What are you doing here, Vicky?"
4,44,Shawn,You're early.
4,44,Shawn,And do you ever take that suit off?
4,44,Shawn,It smells terrible.
4,44,Michael,It does?
4,44,Shawn,No need to be alarmed.
4,44,Shawn,"I know this might look like Michael, the traitorous slam-pig."
4,44,Shawn,"However, this is actually our very own Vicky, wearing the latest in demon technology: a custom-made, look-alike skinsuit!"
4,44,Shawn,"Spin around for us, would ya, hon?"
4,44,Shawn,"As you are all aware, our current system suffers from diminishing returns."
4,44,Shawn,"Sure, the first time someone gets butthole spiders, he's miserable."
4,44,Shawn,"But soon, the humans get used to it, and worse, the spiders get bored."
4,44,Shawn,These personalized skinsuits represent the dawn of a new era: Torture 2.0.
4,44,Michael,Oh!
4,44,Michael,"And speaking of which, I figured Demon Con would be the best place to surprise you with my greatest invention."
4,44,Michael,Come on out Jason.
4,44,Michael,I had the boys down in R&D make a Jason suit.
4,44,Michael,"Thought it'd be a fun, new way to torture Janet."
4,44,Michael,Come on.
4,44,Michael,Come on.
4,44,Michael,Here you go.
4,44,Shawn,I didn't okay this.
4,44,Michael,"I know, but, hey, I'm Vicky!"
4,44,Michael,I'm a total munch.
4,44,Shawn,That you are.
4,44,Shawn,Good point.
4,44,Shawn,Hmm.
4,44,Shawn,Not bad.
4,44,Shawn,"They went a little overboard on the cheekbones, but still."
4,44,Shawn,"Wait, who's in there?"
4,44,Michael,Glenn.
4,44,Shawn,Makes sense.
4,44,Shawn,Get an idiot to play an idiot.
4,44,Shawn,"I was beginning to wonder where you were, Glenn."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I'm right here in Jason.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Definitely not a big bucket of goo.
4,44,Michael,Okay.
4,44,Michael,"Say, boss, what do you say we put these innovative suits of yours to work?"
4,44,Michael,We'll go torture Good Janet and let you know how it goes.
4,44,Michael,Which way is it again?
4,44,Shawn,Wait.
4,44,Shawn,I have a better idea.
4,44,Shawn,"I say we torture Good Janet, right here, right now, live on stage."
4,44,Shawn,"Rufus, go get the Good Janet."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,This part of your plan seems risky.
4,44,Michael,This was not a part of my plan.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Oh.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Thank God, I thought you had a bad plan!"
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Okay, it's easy."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Just hit the button.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,You've seen Mindy do it a million times.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Yeah, here we go."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"No, no, no, don't kill me, me."
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Don't do it.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Huh.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,"Now, why is that so hard?"
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,I kinda you know what?
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,I see what I gotta do.
4,44,Derek Hofstetler,Just kinda look at this Derek!
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excellent.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, what were you thinking?"
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I just wanted to be useful.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"All I ever get to do here is throw parties, which is all I ever got to do back on Earth and now I've ruined everything."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you gave us a way out."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, I fixed everything."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, you've made things difficult in a new way, but I can make it work."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,But the important thing is I did something.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Be quiet and follow my lead.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, ma'am."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on out, bud."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Am I close?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, there's, like, 4,000 clues in here."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You found five.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm just gonna skip to the end.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,This puzzle was going to take you on adventures all over the neighborhood.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Horseback riding, hot air ballooning and I asked Tahani to be involved because she did all of those things on Earth."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You've been in paradise for a month, and you're still so reluctant to try new activities."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I know, I'm just not a new-experience kind of guy."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, my comfort zone is basically, like that chair."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"And, honestly, the arms are a little sharp."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,I want you to believe that you're safe here.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,That you can trust me.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Do you trust me, Chidi?"
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,I really do.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then come with me.
4,44,Shawn,These personalized skinsuits are a true game-changer.
4,44,Shawn,"Imagine being able to torment a human not as yourself, but as their wife, or ex-wife, or just some mouthy broad."
4,44,Shawn,"They are so convincing, they even work on a Good Janet!"
4,44,Janet,Jeez!
4,44,Janet,Ugh.
4,44,Janet,"Great, more Vicky."
4,44,Janet,"Hey, your Michael impression stinks almost as much as your suit."
4,44,Michael,Why does everyone keep saying that?
4,44,Janet,Pfft.
4,44,Janet,Oof.
4,44,Shawn,"Welcome, Janet."
4,44,Shawn,We have a special guest for you today.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, Janet."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"It's me, Jason."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Your boyfriend.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,I really miss you.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"I know we were in a fight before, but I hope you've forgiven me because I love you girl."
4,44,Janet,Not a girl.
4,44,Michael,"Well, Janet?"
4,44,Janet,Yeah.
4,44,Michael,How's that make you feel?
4,44,Janet,Terrible.
4,44,Shawn,"Adequate work, Glenn."
4,44,Shawn,"Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell."
4,44,Janet,"No, no, no."
4,44,Michael,"Oh, no, please, uh, let us take Janet back ourselves."
4,44,Michael,I wanna get a little extra torture time in on the way there.
4,44,Shawn,I don't see why not.
4,44,Vicky,"Hello, dummies."
4,44,Vicky,"It's me, Michael."
4,44,Vicky,I'm just kidding.
4,44,Vicky,"It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit."
4,44,Vicky,What's going on here?
4,44,Vicky,I was never told that I had an understudy.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There you go, buddy."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're doing great.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Where are we going?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Um somewhere fun.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just follow my voice.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ooh!
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"This is, uh kinda fun."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm very scared, but also I like it?"
4,44,Phil,"Hi, there."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Hi, whoever you are."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, don't mind us."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,We're just doing a trust thing.
4,44,Phil,"Hi, there."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,What was that sound?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Uh a unicorn died.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,No.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I mean, not a unicorn, uh, my mistake."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Just a regular horse that someone stabbed in the head.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,44,Shawn,What in the name of Kevin Spacey's self-made Christmas Eve video message to try to get back on House of Cards is going on here?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Mike.
4,44,Shawn,Who are you?
4,44,Vicky,Who am I?
4,44,Michael,You had this the whole time?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"I wanted to explode a bunch of demons, but you told me I should wait, so I did."
4,44,Shawn,"Vicky, why did you build a second Michael suit?"
4,44,Vicky,He didn't.
4,44,Vicky,"No, I mean, I didn't."
4,44,Vicky,Oh.
4,44,Vicky,Look
4,44,Shawn,It can't be.
4,44,Michael,"Yes, it's true."
4,44,Michael,"It's me, the real Michael."
4,44,Michael,We know all about your plot to sabotage our experiment.
4,44,Michael,We know you brought Chris in to pretend to be Linda to distract us while you planted a Bad Janet to pretend to be a Good Janet.
4,44,Shawn,"No, stop clapping."
4,44,Shawn,This is real.
4,44,Shawn,Someone capture them.
4,44,Michael,"Rufus, I'm warning you."
4,44,Michael,I know we go way back.
4,44,Michael,We used to be roommates.
4,44,Michael,"But if you take another step, I will use this demon exploder on you."
4,44,Shawn,"A ""demon exploder""?"
4,44,Shawn,"Come on, man."
4,44,Shawn,At least try to make that sound convincing.
4,44,Shawn,Wow.
4,44,Shawn,Touche.
4,44,Michael,I used to be just like all of you.
4,44,Michael,"I sat right where you're sitting, at more than 10,000 Demon Cons, and I believed that we committed torture as a part of the moral balance of the universe."
4,44,Michael,But I've learned that's wrong.
4,44,Michael,"Humans are capable of self-improvement, and so are we."
4,44,Michael,"And down deep, Shawn knows this is true, too."
4,44,Michael,"I beg you, open your eyes to the truth."
4,44,Vicky,"Bravo, Michael."
4,44,Vicky,What a monologue not!
4,44,Vicky,I'm not scared of you.
4,44,Vicky,"Because I've gone there, Michael."
4,44,Vicky,I've become you.
4,44,Vicky,"You may act like you've changed, but deep down, you're still a demon."
4,44,Vicky,"Vile, ugly, capable of so much darkness."
4,44,Vicky,And now you're home.
4,44,Shawn,"Oh, come on!"
4,44,Michael,Let's go.
4,44,Michael,Come on.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Let's go.
4,44,Shawn,"No, you morons."
4,44,Shawn,Stop applauding them.
4,44,Shawn,They're getting away.
4,44,Todd Hemple,I swear the production value at Demon Con gets better every year.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,"Man, look at this house."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,And that beautiful lake.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,I can't believe I almost missed all this.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Is this the answer to the truth about the universe?
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well --
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,Uh part of it.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,The puzzle continues.
4,44,Simone Garnett,"Hey, you decided to come after all."
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,I did.
4,44,Chidi Anagonye,Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.
4,44,Simone Garnett,Aw!
4,44,Simone Garnett,You two are the best.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that was insane."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,But we got through it together.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, we didn't."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You got through it.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I almost ruined it a hundred times.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"From now on, I'm just gonna stick to throwing parties, because it's the only thing I'm good at."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hey.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When I said ""throw a party"", I didn't mean a pity party."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,This isn't a pity party.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm genuinely sad.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,The only thing I can do is throw pointless parties.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You run the entire neighborhood.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're so capable.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I have seen you get stuck in any manner of crazy situation, and you always figure a way out."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, because I've had to scrape and claw my way through life, and you grew up in a castle full of diamond lamps and golden pillowcases."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,You never learned how to think on your feet.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, if the roles were reversed, and I had to throw a fancy party to save all of humanity, I promise we'd be screwed, because I wouldn't know what salad fork to put next to the whatever spoon."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,The whatever spoon is really only used for certain festive jellies.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,See?
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Babe, the dodos in that house are literally the four most important human beings in the universe."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,I wanted you to take care of them because I trust you.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, your parties aren't pointless."
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,They're opportunities for them to bond and form friendships.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, the thing we need them to do so we're not all tortured forever?"
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're right.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,And thank you.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But if we ever get through this, I want to learn how to do something meaningful."
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,A real skill.
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Something helpful and fulfilling.
4,44,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, man, if we survive this, I promise I will support you while you learn to weld or whatever, deal?"
4,44,Tahani Al-Jamil,Deal.
4,44,Janet,That oughta stop them from following us.
4,44,Michael,So smart.
4,44,Michael,"Nice to have you back, Janet."
4,44,Janet,That must have been hard for you to go back there.
4,44,Michael,It was.
4,44,Michael,I don't like thinking about who I used to be.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Listen, Michael, it's okay to feel or plead guilty about bad things you used to do, but you don't have to feel shame about who you were, because you're not a demon anymore."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"You're just like a nice, weird, happy old dude."
4,44,Michael,Huh.
4,44,Janet,Thanks for rescuing me.
4,44,Janet,I missed you so much.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"I missed you, too."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Bad Janet was so mean to me.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,She told me so many lies.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,"Like, she said the Jags cut Blake Bortles."
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Can you believe that?
4,44,Janet,"Oh, no."
4,44,Janet,"Jason, that wasn't a lie."
4,44,Janet,Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,What?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,How?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Why?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Who's their QB now?
4,44,Janet,A man named Nick Foles.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Nick Foles?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Are you kidding me?
4,44,Jason Mendoza,He won a Super Bowl!
4,44,Jason Mendoza,We're gonna be unstoppable!
4,44,Jason Mendoza,Foles!
4,44,Janet,Foles!
4,44,Michael,Foles!
4,44,Janet,"Oh, no."
4,44,Janet,Nick Foles just broke his clavicle.
4,44,Jason Mendoza,No!
4,45,Bad Janet,"Oh, hi, dip-shirt."
4,45,Michael,"Hello, Bad Janet."
4,45,Michael,How are you today?
4,45,Bad Janet,Terrible.
4,45,Michael,"I'm here to let you know that after six months of captivity, here in Good Janet's void, today's your last day."
4,45,Michael,I'm gonna tell you a story.
4,45,Michael,"And once that's done, I'm getting rid of you."
4,45,Bad Janet,Wow.
4,45,Bad Janet,Sounds like someone finally put on his big-boy demon pants.
4,45,Bad Janet,"So, what's the story?"
4,45,Bad Janet,"Another one of your attempts to prove that humans are ""good"" and ""worthy of respect"" and not ""big fat sacks of dookie""?"
4,45,Michael,Something like that.
4,45,Michael,Are you ready?
4,45,Bad Janet,"One thing, real quick, before you start"
4,45,Bad Janet,Wow.
4,45,Bad Janet,She's gonna last.
4,45,Bad Janet,Is that your story?
4,45,Bad Janet,Looks boring.
4,45,Michael,This book is a part of the story.
4,45,Michael,You'll see.
4,45,Bad Janet,Ugh.
4,45,Michael,It all started about a week ago.
4,45,Michael,We'd sent the four humans on a ski trip
4,45,Bad Janet,And they all skied off a cliff and they broke all their bones and their pants fell down and you could see their butts.
4,45,Bad Janet,The end.
4,45,Michael,"Actually, it went better than we could've possibly hoped."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Well, I admit it."
4,45,Simone Garnett,I was wrong.
4,45,Simone Garnett,That was super fun!
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah!
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, I couldn't actually go skiing, because moving at an angle terrifies me, but that lodge had so many reading nooks."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Just everywhere you look nook.
4,45,John Wheaton,Plus Jianyu guided us on that amazing meditation.
4,45,John Wheaton,"Oh, do you guys want to share what your mantra is?"
4,45,John Wheaton,"Mine is Cate Blanchett saying, ""Rihanna""."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Congrats again, on the gin rummy win."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I thought I was gonna take you down, 'cause I used to play all the time back in college."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Ah, you went to Rutgers, right?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"No, I went to Princeton."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Yeah, I know."
4,45,Simone Garnett,I'm messing with you.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Oh.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Nice one.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, you were joking, though, right?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"You know it's Prince yeah, you know."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, team."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well done.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They're all kinda killing it, but Brent has definitely made the most progress."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards, he didn't flip the table and storm off."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,He just stormed off.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,That's big.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, we still don't know if he's really changed, or if he's just trying to get into ""super heaven""."
4,45,Michael,But his behavior's changing.
4,45,Michael,"Remember, that's the roadmap."
4,45,Michael,"First, we change the behavior, then we work on motivation."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,And now
4,45,Michael,Oh-ho-ho.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop, the moment you've all been waiting for.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,The humanity savior of the week goes to Jason!
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Aww.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Yes!
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,And the award for hottest savior of the week goes to Eleanor Shellstrop!
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Whoop-whoop!
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thank you, I accept."
4,45,Michael,"I never win ""hottest""."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know what to tell you, man."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Maybe do some squats.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pop that booty a little bit.
4,45,Michael,It was a real high point.
4,45,Michael,"The ski trip, I mean, not the completely rigged hotness contest."
4,45,Michael,"All in all, it was the best we'd ever felt about the experiment."
4,45,Bad Janet,Ugh.
4,45,Michael,And then Brent did something very Brentian.
4,45,Bad Janet,Who could've predicted that?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Oh!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, ski bunnies."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"So, great news."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I, uh, wrote a book, and since you're my nerdiest friends, you get to be the first to read it."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"""Six Feet Under Par: A Chip Driver Mystery""."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Yeah.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"It's half-spy novel, half-murder mystery."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"It's also half-submarine adventure, half-erotic memoir, and half-political thriller."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"It's also half-golf tutorial, and half-commentary on society."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"So, it's three-and-a-half books in one?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,At least.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"So, read it ASAP."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I'm having a book-signing party and I want you to introduce me.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"You know, talk about how great it is."
4,45,Simone Garnett,Oh!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Party's in two days, so chop-chop."
4,45,Simone Garnett,Tahani.
4,45,Simone Garnett,Cancel your plans.
4,45,Simone Garnett,We're gonna split a bottle of wine and read Brent's terrible novel out loud.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, dear."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,He did seem nicer on the ski trip.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,He made us all s'mores.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Though to be fair, he did also claim to have invented them."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Before you defend him, you might wanna check out Chip Driver's love interest."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Her name was Scarlett Pakistan, and she was the type of girl you couldn't take in all at once, or you'd die."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You had to take her in bit by bit, like a great work of art, like the Louvre."""
4,45,Michael,"""Her brown eyes were as brown as the brownest crayon."
4,45,Michael,"She had legs like Jessica Rabbit from that movie."""
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Her long, flowing locks smelled like the moon at twilight on a par four."""
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry about this.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've been through worse.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party, I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi and Elon Musk."
4,45,Michael,This is bad.
4,45,Michael,Brent and Simone is our trickiest relationship.
4,45,Michael,"She tends to make snap judgments about people, and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms the accuracy of her snap judgments."
4,45,Michael,We need her to believe that Brent is better than his worst actions.
4,45,Michael,"Like saying that Tahani ""has an accent like the Queen of England, but without any of the old, gross face parts""."
4,45,Michael,We felt like we could contain the fallout from Brent's book.
4,45,Michael,"But as is often the case with these things, the negative effects started to ripple out."
4,45,Bad Janet,Oh.
4,45,Bad Janet,"Like when someone throws up on a bus, and then someone smells it and they throw up?"
4,45,Michael,"Sure, yeah."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"What's wrong, homie?"
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, Brent wrote this book and clearly, he put some of us in it."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"There's a cowardly character named Four-Eyed Igby who ""wears glasses and sweater-vests and never does anything spontaneous or cool""."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,I am educating you in ethics.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,What could be cooler than that?
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"If you want to try something spontaneous, I'm your guy."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"Almost everything I did on Earth I did without thinking, or worrying about what would happen."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"That's how I got my nickname, The Defendant."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Not the best argument, but you're right."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,What is something spontaneous that I can do right now?
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's come up with a list of ten possibilities, and then slowly whittle it down over the next four days."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"Better idea, let's dance, baby."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Hmm?
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Get you out of your head.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"This is how we defeat Igby, the no-fun nerd."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Look at ol' Igby move.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,There you go.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,I've never heard this before.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Who is it?
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Me.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,I wrote it.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"This song is called, ""I'll Love You Forever, parentheses: (Make that Booty Bounce in the Bath)""."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,Oh.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,"Fun fact, the police sirens in the background are real."
4,45,Jason Mendoza,I was being chased as I recorded it.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no"
4,45,John Wheaton,"Oh, my Gaga."
4,45,Michael,"So, obviously, this was a troubling development."
4,45,Bad Janet,Ugh!
4,45,Bad Janet,Can you just skip to the end?
4,45,Michael,No.
4,45,Michael,I need to tell you the whole story.
4,45,Bad Janet,Why?
4,45,Bad Janet,Every story about humans ends the same way.
4,45,Bad Janet,Just tell me how they screwed up and put me out of my misery.
4,45,Michael,You're judging them too quickly.
4,45,Michael,"Trust me, I've spent a lot more time with people than you have."
4,45,Bad Janet,And I know literally everything that every one of them has ever done.
4,45,Bad Janet,Do you know what's happening right now on Earth?
4,45,Bad Janet,"Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants are refusing to vaccinate their children."
4,45,Bad Janet,Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing the charger cable shape again.
4,45,Bad Janet,"Where does this hope come from, man?"
4,45,Bad Janet,This insane hope that people are worth the trouble.
4,45,Bad Janet,"To quote a terrible song by a terrible musician that people love so much they constantly put it in terrible movie trailers, humans are ""b-b-b-bad to the bone""."
4,45,Michael,"Well, I think they're g-g-g-good sometimes, and you should give them the b-b-b-benefit of the d-d-d-doubt."
4,45,Michael,Now where was I?
4,45,Bad Janet,Ugh!
4,45,Michael,So.
4,45,Michael,John had just accidentally discovered the truth about Jason.
4,45,Michael,Keeping a secret like this is exactly the kind of thing that John struggled with on Earth.
4,45,Michael,"Or to put it in terms you'll understand, the gossip toilet was about to overflow."
4,45,Bad Janet,Oh.
4,45,Bad Janet,I do understand that now.
4,45,Bad Janet,Thank you.
4,45,John Wheaton,"So, Jianyu is really Jason from Florida?"
4,45,John Wheaton,Who else knows about this?
4,45,John Wheaton,Is it just me?
4,45,John Wheaton,Is it an exclusive?
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Yes, and we have to keep it that way."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"If the truth comes out, we have no idea what will happen to Jason."
4,45,John Wheaton,You don't know what you're asking of me.
4,45,John Wheaton,"Look, the neighborhood is obviously amazing, but it's also a little ""Season 4 of Downton Abbey""."
4,45,John Wheaton,"Beautifully designed, but a real snoozefest."
4,45,John Wheaton,Jason being a mistake is easily the most exciting thing that's happened since we got here.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"What if, in exchange for your discretion, Jason teaches you that Magic Mike body roll thing?"
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Huh?
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you always said you've wanted to learn that."
4,45,John Wheaton,Fine.
4,45,John Wheaton,But I wanna learn the whole dance.
4,45,Michael,"We'd hoped Simone would forget all about Brent's book, but unfortunately"
4,45,Simone Garnett,"""Chip Driver pulled up to the murder site in his 1968 Cadillac."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Keep it close,' he growled to the valet, Luis."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Of course, senor,' said Luis, who secretly admired Chip more than even his own father."""
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"""Chip gazed at the sexy outline of the murder victim on the floor."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"What a waste of curves,' he growled."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He checked his Rolex watch, which was real."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It was almost golf o'clock, so the case would have to wait."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Good thing he'd already solved it.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"The killer was Luis, the valet."""
4,45,Simone Garnett,He solves the murder on page ten.
4,45,Simone Garnett,What is the rest of this book about?
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"How's it going, ladies?"
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Oh, you know, just delving into the great works of literature."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, so, listen."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um maybe Brent made some insensitive choices, but could you possibly see your way to forgiving him?"
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,I suppose.
4,45,Simone Garnett,No.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,No?
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Sorry, but no, I can't."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"This book is objectifying, misogynistic and racist."
4,45,Simone Garnett,Why are we still dealing with this shirt in the Good Place?
4,45,Simone Garnett,"When people like him are ignorant jerks, why are people like us asked to forgive him?"
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Also, and this is less important, why is he in a fighter jet for his author photo?"
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I can answer the last one."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's because he loves Top Gun.
4,45,Simone Garnett,Oh.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"As for the other questions, I will get back to you, after I consult a number of immortal beings, who are very wise."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Didn't take you for a linksman.
4,45,Michael,I appreciate golf.
4,45,Michael,"As Ben Hogan once said, ""The most important shot in golf is the next one."""
4,45,Michael,That's a lovely idea.
4,45,Michael,"If you make a mistake, you always have a chance to redeem yourself."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Yeah, well, as John Daly once said to David Lee Roth at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando, ""Suck on this drive, buttmunch!"""
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Whoo!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Nailed it.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,That was a flusher but she sank.
4,45,Michael,Perhaps an adept linksman like yourself should play with the assistance filter turned off?
4,45,Michael,Let's play old-school.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,All right.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Why not?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Fork!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"You sneezed, man."
4,45,Michael,"I don't think I sneezed, because I literally can't."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Well, somebody sneezed."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Damn it.
4,45,Michael,"Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed."
4,45,Michael,"You hit a bad shot, and it's fine."
4,45,Michael,"You know, it isn't a sign of weakness to admit that you screwed up."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Fine, whatever, I shanked it."
4,45,Michael,There ya go.
4,45,Michael,"Now let's go find your ball, and try to do better on your next shot."
4,45,Michael,"And you know, if this ends up applying to any other aspect of your life later on, then cool."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,What?
4,45,Michael,What?
4,45,Michael,Nothing.
4,45,Michael,Nothing.
4,45,Michael,"I gotta say, Bad Janet, I really felt like I had managed to stop the bleeding."
4,45,Bad Janet,You thought that dingdong would do a total personality 180 because of one gentle metaphor?
4,45,Michael,What can I say?
4,45,Michael,I'm an optimist.
4,45,Michael,"But two days later, at the event, it fell apart almost immediately."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, uh, thanks for not telling anyone about Jason."
4,45,John Wheaton,"Oh, well, ever since I arrived here, Tahani helped me realize that gossip was an unhealthy way for me to boost my self-esteem."
4,45,John Wheaton,"But on the other hand, this Jason tea needs to be spilled."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Just try to remember what Immanuel Kant said, ""It is your duty to keep your friend's secrets."""
4,45,John Wheaton,"But my favorite philosopher, Bethenny Frankel, would say that I have a duty to ""mention it all!"""
4,45,John Wheaton,"And ""if you can't handle the truth, then you can't handle me""."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Once again, I beg you, please listen to Immanuel Kant and not Bethenny Frankel."
4,45,John Wheaton,Gah!
4,45,John Wheaton,"Well, I gotta goss about something."
4,45,John Wheaton,What about a few blind items that I picked up around the neighborhood?
4,45,John Wheaton,You wanna know who wears the same dumb shorts every day?
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I don't."
4,45,John Wheaton,"It's ""Dumb Shorts Cathy""."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Simone?
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, I have been thinking about those very good questions that you asked me."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm sorry for the delay.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,The ancient scrolls I had to consult were very hard to roll back up.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, anyway, I thought about what you should say to Brent when he asks for your opinion of his novel."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Me, too."
4,45,Simone Garnett,I have a great idea.
4,45,Simone Garnett,I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, listen."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're absolutely right that Brent needs to evolve, but there may be a more subtle way to make that happen."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, there they are."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Charlie's Angles.
4,45,Michael,Oof.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"So, did you finish the book?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,What'd you think?
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, very interesting word choices."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I've definitely never seen the word ""pants-tent"" used so many times."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Yeah.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I kinda just felt like, in that moment, that that's what the surgeon general would say."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,What else?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Let's hear some more complos.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Compliments.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,For when you introduce me.
4,45,Simone Garnett,Just writing a book is an amazing accomplishment.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,You bet your butt it is.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"The story's incredible, too."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, Chip solves the mystery on page ten."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Greatest detective ever.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"So, hop on up there, and just speak from the heart about how it's your favorite book ever."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Actually, I have to say, um, the Scarlett Pakistan character is clearly based on Tahani, and it's not exactly flattering."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Not flattering?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I said she's got huge ones.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Ultimate complo.
4,45,Michael,"Yeah, see, there Brent, remember our conversation about making mistakes and how the most important shot is the next one?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Hang on a second.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,You guys agree with her?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Unreal.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I didn't ask to get yelled at by the PC police.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,You know I was gonna give you 10% off the cover price.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,But now you're gonna have to pay the full 65 bucks like everybody else.
4,45,Michael,There's no money here.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Book event is canceled.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Because of these mean women.
4,45,Michael,"Oh, man."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Perhaps I can convince Simone to handle this the British way: smile bravely, bury your feelings and allow a steady drizzle to slowly wash away your sadness over 50 years."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,F that.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Simone is not the problem.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brent is.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He needs to change, and walking on eggshells around him ain't gonna do the trick."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to throw the egg right at his face.
4,45,Michael,You're right.
4,45,Michael,Enough is enough.
4,45,Michael,He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.
4,45,Michael,This experiment is more than halfway over.
4,45,Michael,"He's got to improve, and we can't wait forever."
4,45,Michael,"Janet, where is he now?"
4,45,Janet,Take a wild guess.
4,45,Michael,"Hey, bud."
4,45,Michael,Whatcha up to?
4,45,Michael,Grippin' and rippin'?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Trying to.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Just seems like the big dog don't wanna hunt today.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"You know, Simone was very mean to me."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Maybe even a little racist.
4,45,Michael,"Well, listen."
4,45,Michael,Art is subjective.
4,45,Michael,"More importantly no other way to put this, buddy."
4,45,Michael,You made a mistake.
4,45,Michael,"Your actions hurt people, and you have to take responsibility for that."
4,45,Michael,You need to come back and apologize.
4,45,Michael,Take the first step toward healing the neighborhood.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Fine.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I'll be the bigger man.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Just like my dad, when he single-handedly took on all those class-action lawsuits."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,I just wish I could get through to the guy.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,I wonder if he'd respond to some social contract theory.
4,45,Simone Garnett,Why are you trying to help him?
4,45,Simone Garnett,He doesn't even know you exist.
4,45,Simone Garnett,He doesn't see other people.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, he did call me ""a four-eyed coward who probably dry-humps books""."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,But why not be a bigger person and rise above it?
4,45,Simone Garnett,I'll tell you why.
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Because doing that sends a message that it's okay to be treated this way, and it's not okay to treat anyone that way."
4,45,Simone Garnett,Not Tahani.
4,45,Simone Garnett,Not me.
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Not even you, Igby."
4,45,Michael,Everyone?
4,45,Michael,"Gather round, please."
4,45,Michael,Brent has something that he'd like to say.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Okay.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Regarding my critically acclaimed novel, I am very sorry if you were offended."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Okay?
4,45,Simone Garnett,Not an apology.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Yes, it was."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Okay, fine."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I'm sorry if what I wrote, which was perfectly okay, somehow made you feel like it wasn't okay."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"But you know what, that's on you."
4,45,Michael,"Brent, wrong direction, bud."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"No, sorry, man, either apologize for real or stop wasting our time."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Okay, you know what?"
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I'm actually not sorry at all.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,How about that?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Is that what you want to hear?
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Very obviously not.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why don't we take a break?
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's all get a snack.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Not until they give me the complos I rightly deserve.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,You want a complo?
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll give you a complo.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,I didn't think it was possible to write a book as awful as yours.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I literally didn't think human beings were capable of such racist, sexist poppycock."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Also, Chip Driver is either a private eye, or the quarterback for the Chicago Bears, or ""the world's strongest president""."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,He cannot be all three.
4,45,Janet,"Oh, boy."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,This is a disgrace.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I accomplished something.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I wrote a novel.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,And now my integrity is being attacked?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I have been called racist, sexist."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I don't have a racist or sexist bone in my body.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I am Brent Norwalk, and I'm a good person."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I'm in the Good Place.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,You ever heard of it?
4,45,Brent Norwalk,And I'm here because I deserve to be here.
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"I'm here because I earned it, by being the best."
4,45,Simone Garnett,"Ugh, you're ridiculous."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Yeah and you're a condescending bench.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, don't talk to her that way, please."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, I have an idea."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Let me summon a few philosophical works we can use --
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Ugh!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Enough with the frickin' books, Igby."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"Yeah, that's right."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,"You probably don't even know this, but that character is based on you."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"No, I knew it, man."
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,Look out!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Ah!
4,45,Brent Norwalk,I'm being attacked again.
4,45,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, that was unintentional."
4,45,Brent Norwalk,Fork you.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, I'm thinking bagel bites for the snack?"
4,45,Bad Janet,Ah.
4,45,Bad Janet,Middle-aged American male fragility.
4,45,Bad Janet,"You know why they're called baby boomers, right?"
4,45,Bad Janet,Because the tiniest little pinprick to their ego and boom!
4,45,Bad Janet,They become babies.
4,45,Michael,"I mean, that was it."
4,45,Michael,We were forked.
4,45,Michael,"Six months of painstaking work, trying to help the four humans overcome their worst instincts and bond as a group."
4,45,Michael,"And in a poof, it was gone."
4,45,Bad Janet,"I told you, man."
4,45,Bad Janet,Humans suck.
4,45,Michael,"Well, this story has one more chapter."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, today was bad."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Today was very bad.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everyone for sure lost a bunch of points.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I don't have a solution.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, let's reset."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'll do something mildly iffy, and let John make a small, good decision to help."
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I could tell him I'm going to get ombre highlights, and let him talk me out of it."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's wrong with ombre highlights?
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Please.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,This week has been hard enough.
4,45,Jason Mendoza,I could set my robes on fire and try and get Brent to put it out.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know you're only suggesting that because you've repeatedly said you would look ""dope"" in flaming monk robes, but that's actually not a bad idea."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Force him to help someone without actually thinking about it.
4,45,Tahani Al-Jamil,Then maybe I'll ask Chidi to lead a class on empathy.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes!
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, let's write these down."
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,We got plenty of time left.
4,45,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can get back on track.
4,45,Michael,That was an hour ago.
4,45,Michael,Right before I came here to see you for the last time.
4,45,Michael,"For months, you and I have been debating, are people good or bad?"
4,45,Michael,"But as I watched those three people pick themselves up and dust themselves off, I realized we've been asking the wrong question."
4,45,Michael,What matters isn't if people are good or bad.
4,45,Michael,What matters is if they're trying to be better today than they were yesterday.
4,45,Michael,You ask me where my hope comes from?
4,45,Michael,That's your answer.
4,45,Bad Janet,What are you doing?
4,45,Michael,Sending you home.
4,45,Michael,"I'm not marbleizing you, Janet."
4,45,Michael,I'm letting you go.
4,45,Michael,I've tried to win you over to our side.
4,45,Michael,"It hasn't worked, so keeping you as a prisoner just seems cruel."
4,45,Michael,Letting you go home is how I've decided to be a little better today than I was yesterday.
4,45,Michael,"Here's your phone and a, uh, parting gift."
4,45,Bad Janet,Oh.
4,45,Bad Janet,Sweet.
4,45,Bad Janet,Is that Brent's book?
4,45,Michael,No.
4,45,Michael,"Uh, I didn't have any cash on me, so I couldn't get you a copy."
4,45,Michael,"This is a manifesto, detailing everything that's happened with the humans."
4,45,Michael,Janet and I wrote it a while back.
4,45,Michael,She's been updating it as we go.
4,45,Michael,I hope you'll read it.
4,45,Bad Janet,Great thinking.
4,45,Bad Janet,People that get books as gifts always read them.
4,45,Bad Janet,Bye!
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,As you reach the end of your first year in the afterlife what do you remember most?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The everlasting friendships you made?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The adversity you overcame together?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The day everything was chocolate?
4,46,Jason Mendoza,That day was awesome.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,It was all chocolate.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You only have a few hours left in your first year, so why not do as many amazing good deeds for other people as you possibly can by midnight?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just in case.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, I'll take it out."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm a little tired, okay?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Lay off.
4,46,Michael,"That movie, minus the part where Eleanor gives away the entire experiment, will play before the party tonight."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Speaking of which, the theme is One Year Down, Infinity to Go."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Dress is London black tie.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That means Knightsbridge black tie, not Kensington."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or heaven forbid West Brompton.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can you imagine?
4,46,Jason Mendoza,No.
4,46,Janet,"Also, just after midnight, in order to reset my processing power, I will be violently eating my Janet babies."
4,46,Janet,I'd advise no one look directly at me.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Copy that.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, tonight at the party, we're gonna go for one more point grab."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm gonna suggest that they make toasts about each other, celebrate their ups and downs, demonstrate personal growth, blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved!"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One more day, guys."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's finish strong.
4,46,Michael,"And to that end, as you might know, I've been practicing human magic."
4,46,Michael,Oh!
4,46,Michael,Ta-da!
4,46,Jason Mendoza,Dope.
4,46,Michael,"So, I was thinking --"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, the Magnificent Dr. Presto is not performing tonight."
4,46,Michael,"Come on, I --"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, magic is always lame, but it's especially lame here, where there's actual magic."
4,46,Michael,As a counter argument check your pocket.
4,46,Michael,The other one.
4,46,Michael,"Oh, shoot, sorry."
4,46,Michael,It's my pocket.
4,46,Michael,Ta-da!
4,46,Jason Mendoza,Dope.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,You know what?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can perform.
4,46,Michael,Really?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, you changed my mind with that pocket thing."
4,46,Michael,"Oh, boffo!"
4,46,Michael,Oh.
4,46,Michael,You're being mean.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yep.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,I am very excited for tonight.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And dare I say, you all look so splendid, you could work the coat check at the Met Gala."
4,46,John Wheaton,"Oh, speaking of the Met Gala, remember that security cam footage of Solange and Jay-Z fighting in the elevator?"
4,46,John Wheaton,I learned to read lips.
4,46,John Wheaton,"Turns out she was yelling, ""No fair!"
4,46,John Wheaton,"I wanted to be the one to push the button."""
4,46,John Wheaton,"So, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy as some people maybe thought it was."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, gang."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Had a pretty good round today.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Better close this door.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I don't want all those birdies to follow me in here.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
4,46,John Wheaton,"Okay, Brent, hurry up and change so we can get to the party."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, right, hang on."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Uh, Janet gave me this tuxedo in a can."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh!
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Ooh.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"You know, I came this close to firing Janet, but she's gotten a lot better."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Okay.
4,46,Simone Garnett,We're not leaving yet.
4,46,Simone Garnett,I need to show you all something.
4,46,Simone Garnett,This is the result of months of observation.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Now, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy"
4,46,John Wheaton,"No, why would we think that?"
4,46,Simone Garnett,But there is something wrong with this neighborhood.
4,46,Simone Garnett,And it involves the people in this room.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,So crazy that we're at the end of this thing and we have no idea how we did.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, any chance you could get a look inside that obelisk?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Check that magic scoreboard?
4,46,Janet,"There is a chance, yes."
4,46,Janet,About one in 970 trillion.
4,46,Janet,Let's give her a whirl.
4,46,Janet,It did not work.
4,46,Janet,I'll be right back.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ugh!
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I feel okay about most of it, but I just wish we had one concrete sign that Brent has improved."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"One moment where he bumps into someone and sincerely says, ""Oops, my bad,"" you know?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I would kill for an ""Oops, my bad."""
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Who's a girl gotta fork to get an ""Oops, my bad""?"
4,46,Michael,"Hey, hey, hey, panicking about this experiment at crucial moments is kinda my move."
4,46,Michael,Don't fall apart on me now.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I won't.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's just you know me.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"On Earth, I never played a game unless I knew I could either win, or bribe the ref so he'd throw it for me, and if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad."
4,46,Michael,Just one more day.
4,46,Michael,"We're gonna stick to the plan, not do anything radical."
4,46,Michael,Though we could do something magical.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You gotta let it go, man."
4,46,Janet,She's right.
4,46,Simone Garnett,I've been suspicious about this place since day one.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Over the last few months, I've been collecting data, and now I am positive."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Something is truly forked up.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"You didn't tell me about any of this, muffin!"
4,46,John Wheaton,"Okay, you call her ""muffin""?"
4,46,John Wheaton,I'm getting a lot of breaking news at once here.
4,46,Simone Garnett,I was gathering evidence.
4,46,Simone Garnett,I didn't want to compromise the integrity of the data collection.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, so romantic."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Here's what I know Eleanor and Michael are up to something, and it's focused on us."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"I mean, there are, like, 300 people in the neighborhood, and somehow, they just spend all of their time talking to the six people in this room."
4,46,John Wheaton,"Well, I mean, who else are they gonna talk to?"
4,46,John Wheaton,Dumb Shorts Cathy?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,What is your problem with her?
4,46,John Wheaton,I mean shorts?
4,46,John Wheaton,"""Cathy""?"
4,46,John Wheaton,What isn't my problem with her?
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Jianyu, you okay?"
4,46,Simone Garnett,You look sweaty.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, no, he's fine."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,He always sweats when he's meditating.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"He calls it ""sweat-itating""."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I mean, um, he doesn't talk, so I call it that."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm friends with Sting.
4,46,John Wheaton,I can't take it anymore.
4,46,John Wheaton,I know something and it's just graduated from hot goss to relevant AF.
4,46,John Wheaton,"Yes, I'm gonna."
4,46,John Wheaton,I'm gonna.
4,46,John Wheaton,That's not Jianyu.
4,46,John Wheaton,"His name is Jason, and he's here by mistake."
4,46,John Wheaton,Chidi's been helping him hide and become a better person.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I also knew about this, of course."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Might as well come clean, darling."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, Simone."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Jason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Go, Jags, obviously."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Um, what else about me"
4,46,Jason Mendoza,I was born in a swimming pool
4,46,Simone Garnett,Okay.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"You never told me about this, Ducky!"
4,46,John Wheaton,"""Ducky""?"
4,46,John Wheaton,I'm gonna have to sit down.
4,46,John Wheaton,This is too much.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I swore I wouldn't tell, and keeping your word is a central tenet of deontological ethics."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Oh, so romantic."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, let's assume certain things are odd about this place."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,What is your theory?
4,46,Simone Garnett,I don't know.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Maybe this isn't the Good Place.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Maybe it's a test.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"My best guess, it's some kind of experiment."
4,46,Simone Garnett,We're being observed in a closed environment.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Simone, look at this logically."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,We are in paradise.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"There's fresh air, mountains, Janet!"
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And yes, some of us are under 5'10"", but other than that, it is literally perfect here."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"No, it is not."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Jason is proof.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"And if you need more evidence that this isn't the Good Place, clearly, he's not the only one who doesn't belong."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Actually, she's right."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,And I know it for a fact.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"For the first time ever, I am desperate for you to keep talking."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Well, right at the beginning, I talked to Mike and Eleanor, and they were like, ""Yeah, don't tell anyone this, but there's a place better than this, the Best Place, and that's where you're headed, amigo."""
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't think they actually called you ""amigo""."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I had to go through the year here, kind of a test I guess, which, obviously, I aced."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"So, at midnight I'm on the first Escalade out of here, baby."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Brent?
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Yeah?
4,46,Simone Garnett,Think about this.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Okay.
4,46,Simone Garnett,How could you get into the Best Place?
4,46,Simone Garnett,You would literally have to be one of the most incredible people in the universe.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I mean, it makes sense to me."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I don't know what to tell you.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Okay, in the words of Princess Kate after we came back from our shopping trip in Ibiza, ""There's a lot to unpack here."""
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Perhaps we should just put our concerns aside and enjoy ourselves.
4,46,Simone Garnett,No way.
4,46,Simone Garnett,We have to figure out exactly what is going on here.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Okay, just go to the party, but keep your eyes open."
4,46,Simone Garnett,I've got a special mission for us.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I --"
4,46,John Wheaton,"Oh, good."
4,46,John Wheaton,Muffin and Ducky are on the case.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,How's it going?
4,46,Jason Mendoza,Awesome.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, it isn't."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, yeah, terrible."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Simone knows the neighborhood isn't what it appears to be.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,She's been collecting evidence for months.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, all that hanging out with Brent, and participating in group activities"
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Was under false pretenses.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,She was observing him.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,She's been observing everything.
4,46,Michael,"Guys, pick a card."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,No time.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The subjects are onto us.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"They know something weird is going on, and it could derail the entire experiment."
4,46,Michael,"Oh, no."
4,46,Michael,"Oh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,46,Simone Garnett,There's nothing here.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Did you find anything?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Just some song lyrics that Michael wrote.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"""Here's a trippy little ditty, 'bout a train to Groovy City."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Open up your freaky crystal mind, and we'll have a cosmic good time."""
4,46,Simone Garnett,"See, that makes me think we're in hell."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, we tried to prove your theory, but it feels like we came up empty."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Chidi, there is so much evidence they've been lying."
4,46,Simone Garnett,How can you not see that?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Eleanor told me that this was her first neighborhood.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Maybe some of these are just honest mistakes.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"And, also, she told me some other stuff that I really want to be true."
4,46,Simone Garnett,What kind of stuff?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, it was something about us."
4,46,Michael,Why does everything I do fall apart so close to the end?
4,46,Michael,"My first experiment, now this experiment."
4,46,Michael,"I only got halfway through writing ""The Purple Train to Groovy City""."
4,46,Michael,I just ran out of creative juice.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Focus.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We cannot let this slip away from us at the last second.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"New plan, forget the toasts."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We do nothing, and we hope that our early successes make up for the embarrassing mess we've become."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like Facebook or America.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sound good?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael?
4,46,Michael,We have no way to know what this really means for the experiment.
4,46,Michael,I don't think we can play it safe.
4,46,Michael,I have a plan.
4,46,Michael,"It's risky, but it might be the only way to get them to where they need to be."
4,46,Michael,Do you trust me?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, fork it."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whatever it is, I'm in."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,I'm always down for forking it.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We trust you, Michael."
4,46,Michael,Then trust the Magnificent Dr. Presto!
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Man, you cannot pull that hat out after you ask us if we trust you."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Soulmates?
4,46,Simone Garnett,"That's what Eleanor said, that we're soulmates?"
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Yep.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Pretty neat, huh?"
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I think it's pretty neat.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Do you think it's pretty neat, intensely, forever?"
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Chidi, I really like you, but I don't think we're soulmates."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Because I don't think soulmates actually exist.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Right.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Right, right."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Right?
4,46,Simone Garnett,Think rationally.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Isn't it weird that she only told one of us that we're soulmates?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Is it odd?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Does it mean that Eleanor's motives are questionable?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Also, yes."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,But does it suggest that she wasn't being truthful?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I'm starting to see your point."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Whoa!
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,What does that mean?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Why are there only four of us?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Why not Tahani and Jason?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Why are there emojis?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, one of them's party hat guy."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, that's good, right?"
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,He's friendly.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"It's better than thermometer guy, or angry cat or smiling poop coil."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Okay.
4,46,Simone Garnett,We have to get back to the party before Eleanor and Michael notice we're missing.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Great plan.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Let's kiss.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Sorry, still thinking about the soulmate thing."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Let's go.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Okay.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ladies and gentlemen I can't believe I'm saying this.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The Magnificent Dr. Presto!
4,46,Michael,Thank you.
4,46,Michael,"Now, I know some of you may not believe in magic --"
4,46,Janet,"Well, I think they believe in some magic."
4,46,Janet,"Yesterday, everybody ate a lollipop that let them talk to birds."
4,46,Michael,"Okay, but this is Earth magic, and it's harder, and if you don't understand that, I'm here to change your mind."
4,46,Michael,Ha-ha!
4,46,Michael,"Oh, come on."
4,46,Michael,It started out as a dollar bill and now it's four quarters.
4,46,Michael,"""Change"" your mind?"
4,46,Janet,"Michael, it's three quarters."
4,46,Michael,What?
4,46,Michael,"Oh, oh"
4,46,Michael,Three quarters.
4,46,Michael,Three quarters.
4,46,Michael,Even harder.
4,46,Michael,Thank you.
4,46,Michael,Can you make them clap harder?
4,46,Janet,"They see what they see, man."
4,46,John Wheaton,Did you guys find anything?
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Yes, proof that the four of us, and only the four of us, are being forked with."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"But we still don't have any hard proof that this place is evil, or that Michael and Eleanor are nefarious, so, you know, no one's heart needs to break just yet."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Yeah, I'm with him."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,This place is fine.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, if you guys don't make the cut for the Best Place, I'll try to put in a good word for you."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,You guys got business cards?
4,46,Michael,Brent.
4,46,Michael,I need a volunteer.
4,46,Michael,Come on up.
4,46,Michael,"Okay, Brent, I want you to take off your wristwatch and place it in my hat."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Now, this is a Rolex."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,It's the exact same watch Richie Sambora wears.
4,46,Michael,Ah!
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Be careful.
4,46,Michael,"And now, the Magnificent Dr. Presto will transform your oh, oh"
4,46,Michael,"Oh, whoa, no, no!"
4,46,Michael,"Brent, can you hear me?"
4,46,Michael,"If it somehow helps, there's a small dove in your pocket."
4,46,Michael,Never mind.
4,46,Michael,"Brent, I'm so sorry."
4,46,Michael,I must've screwed up the trick somehow.
4,46,Michael,Hold on.
4,46,Michael,We're gonna get you out of there.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Yeah, you better."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands!
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm gonna frickin' own this place.
4,46,Michael,Okay.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, everyone, uh, please disperse."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We'll let you know when it's safe.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, you three stay here."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Keep an eye on Brent.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're gonna try and fix this remotely, using eternal-being technology."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Right-o.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, so what do we do?"
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Try to climb down or wait for the rope?
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Neither, we get the fork out of here."
4,46,John Wheaton,"Chidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up and swallowed one of us."
4,46,John Wheaton,I don't care what this place really is.
4,46,John Wheaton,Giant holes are bad and we should go.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Or giant holes are bad, so if someone falls into one, you try to help get him out."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm not scared.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm shouting so you know I'm okay.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I am very brave.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I hope this works.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We basically just confirmed that we're lying to them.
4,46,Michael,"Oh, man."
4,46,Michael,Was this a bad idea?
4,46,Michael,"I mean, what if this was a bad idea?"
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"It wasn't, homie."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,It was a good idea.
4,46,Michael,Can anyone else weigh in?
4,46,Jason Mendoza,I'm serious.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"In football, trying to run out the clock and hoping for the best never works."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,It's called prevent defense.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,You don't take any chances and just try and hang on to your lead.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,But prevent defense just prevents you from winning.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,It's always better to try something.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, that was coherent!"
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, sorry."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,I didn't mean to.
4,46,Janet,"It's a good plan, Michael."
4,46,Janet,"Hopefully, they've bonded enough as a group to rescue Brent, call me, get a train and all head out of here together."
4,46,Michael,But was it a mistake to have Brent fall in?
4,46,Michael,"We could've had Chidi fall in, right?"
4,46,Michael,Or a cute baby panda.
4,46,Michael,"Or maybe, you know, a box of donuts."
4,46,Michael,Everyone loves donuts.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brent was the right choice.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's not a tough call whether to save Chidi, because he's a brilliant and kind person, with a caboose you can bounce a quarter off of and I know 'cause I've done it."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We threw Brent in there because there is no reason any of them should help him, because Brent sucks."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brent is the opposite of a box of donuts.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,Toilet full of broccoli.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, kinda."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Brent is a toilet full of broccoli.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But because he sucks so bad, if they do risk their safety to help him, they'll get more points."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"Basically, it's a Hail Mary."
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"It's risky, but if we complete it, we win the game."
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was two good analogies in a row.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm now worried that he's a demon in a Jason suit.
4,46,John Wheaton,Are we really in hell?
4,46,John Wheaton,"I mean, I didn't lead a perfect life on Earth, but I worked very hard."
4,46,Simone Garnett,Making fun of people you'd never even met.
4,46,John Wheaton,"Well, I guess you must be right, Simone, because you always have to be."
4,46,John Wheaton,"Hey, are you the bottom of a coal-fired pizza?"
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Why, because I'm burnt?"
4,46,John Wheaton,Gah!
4,46,John Wheaton,You are always right.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, if it is hell, I know why I'm here."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Almond milk.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"I drank so much of it, despite the negative environmental impacts."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Okay, wherever we are, I do not wanna be here when the clock hits zero."
4,46,Simone Garnett,"Okay, now might be our only chance to escape."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Not without Brent.
4,46,John Wheaton,"Do you think if the roles were reversed, he would waste any time rescuing you?"
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Maybe if Ellen Macpherson were nearby and he wanted to impress her, or if he thought that I was a prince he could ransom that's not the point."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,He is a person in a hole.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I have a duty to help him get out.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,What he would do is irrelevant.
4,46,Simone Garnett,I don't think it is.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"If you do a science experiment a thousand times and always get the same results, you move on."
4,46,Simone Garnett,We've given Brent a thousand chances to be a good person.
4,46,Simone Garnett,"In one of them, he was so awful, you punched him in the face."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, when I did that, I thought cutting him out of our group meant that he would have to find another place in heaven to hang out."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,That's changed.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I can't just leave him.
4,46,Simone Garnett,Well I respect your position.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I respect yours.
4,46,John Wheaton,"Look, I know everything's really scary right now, but I just have to say it."
4,46,John Wheaton,That was the most boring breakup I've ever seen.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Hey, Chidi, shake it off."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Another bus comes every 15 minutes.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Brent.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are they?
4,46,Janet,They never called a train.
4,46,Janet,They must've taken Brent's Escalade.
4,46,Michael,"Oh, that's good."
4,46,Michael,The important thing is that the group bonded and stayed together.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Hello?
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Can someone help us?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Us""?"
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Yeah, this frickin' genius tried to help me and he fell in."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I thought you were smart, man."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Are you serious right now?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, turns out the group did not bond."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,The group snapped in half.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Will you help us?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,These rocks are really sharp down here.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I'm scared.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm not.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just give us a second.
4,46,Michael,"Guys, I think we're cooked."
4,46,Michael,It's over.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,No way.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I am not giving up.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I told you I only play games I can win, and I played this game, so that means we can win."
4,46,Janet,I don't think that tracks.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shut up.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you know?
4,46,Janet,"Literally everything, but keep going."
4,46,Janet,I am liking this energy from you.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We have eight minutes left, so that means we keep trying."
4,46,Michael,What else can we try?
4,46,Michael,We've already blown everything up.
4,46,Michael,We can't blow it up again.
4,46,Jason Mendoza,"If there's one thing I know in this world, it's that you can always blow up the same thing twice."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's right.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We have one last move here.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, we are so sorry about your ordeal."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We just have a few questions for you.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where are John and Simone?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can't find them.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,They left.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know where they went.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Typical.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Disloyal jerks.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, man, actually, they really tried with you, and you made it very hard to be your friend."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,You wanna know what happened?
4,46,Brent Norwalk,They got jealous because I'm going to the Best Place.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,They bugged out.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,You're not going to the Best Place.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Don't you get it?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,They're torturing you.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,They're torturing all of us.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Because this is the Bad Place.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't believe you figured it out.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Wait, he's right?"
4,46,Brent Norwalk,This is the Bad Place?
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Damn it, he's right."
4,46,Michael,"Yeah, we had a good run, though, didn't we?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we did."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"So, no Best Place?"
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Oh, so, no Best Place?"""
4,46,Michael,"Oh, Brent, you big white oaf."
4,46,Michael,"Never change, bud."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I guess we should let them know you guys are on your way."
4,46,Michael,Yeah.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,Wait.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,On our way where?
4,46,Michael,The actual Bad Place.
4,46,Michael,"They let us toy with you a little just for kicks, but now you're going"
4,46,Michael,And trust me on this it's a lot worse.
4,46,Tahani Al-Jamil,Well done.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's hope it works.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,We only have a minute left.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Man, crazy twist, huh?"
4,46,Brent Norwalk,It's like something out of a Chip Driver novel.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Leave me alone, Brent."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I'm kinda freaking out over here, man."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,You're my only real friend.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not your friend.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,I don't even like you.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,But you helped me.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I did."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,Because I have this stupid moral code that forces me to help everyone.
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"But you have never helped anyone because you don't care about other people, which is the bare minimum that a person has to do."
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,"Just care, a little, about the other people around you, and you can't do it."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,What are you trying to say here?
4,46,Chidi Anagonye,You are a bad person.
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,You can do this.
4,46,Michael,"Come on, dumb-dumb."
4,46,Michael,Faster.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"No, I'm not."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not I'm not a bad person."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm not.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,I'm a good person.
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, man."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"No, no."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"Look, Chidi, whatever happens next, I, uh, need to say this to you."
4,46,Brent Norwalk,All right?
4,46,Brent Norwalk,"I am I am so, so, sor --"
4,46,Janet,"Sorry, Eleanor asked me to bring her this the second the experiment was over."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, you know what they say."
4,46,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's zero o'clock in the sky somewhere.
4,47,Matt,"Well, that's just that's uncomfortable."
4,47,Matt,"Oh, hey, guys."
4,47,Matt,What's up?
4,47,Michael,"""What's up?"""
4,47,Michael,Tell us what happened.
4,47,Michael,Did we win?
4,47,Michael,Did we lose?
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is humanity saved forever?
4,47,Jason Mendoza,And did you find my Nintendo?
4,47,Jason Mendoza,I can't find it any whoop!
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Never mind.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,I'm holding it.
4,47,Matt,Sorry.
4,47,Matt,I can't reveal the results of the experiment until we get to the Judge's chambers.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where is everyone?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Where's Simone, and John and Brent, and actually I don't care about any of those doofs."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where's Chidi?
4,47,Janet,"Oh, he's on the toilet."
4,47,Janet,"Sorry, that's not enough information."
4,47,Janet,"The test subjects are frozen in stasis, so I put them in the bathroom and I placed Chidi on the toilet."
4,47,Janet,The best seat.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's wake him up.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, so I can, like, be reunited with the man I love?"
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Snappy, snappy, memory fixxy?"
4,47,Matt,The Judge says no one gets unfrozen until she's ruled on the case.
4,47,Matt,"Oh, uh, humans have to stay here."
4,47,Matt,You can't see the numbers.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hang on.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I worked my ash off running this neighborhood for a full year, and I'm not even allowed to hear how we did?"
4,47,Michael,Yes.
4,47,Michael,And here's a bottle of tequila.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, let us know how it goes."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Regardless of what the Judge rules, this feels like some sort of goodbye."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Even if we succeeded, there's no guarantee she'll keep us together."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,She might just snap her fingers and send us flying into different dimensions.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,How was that?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did I cheer everyone up?
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man, are we gonna die again?"
4,47,Jason Mendoza,We've died so many times.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"We've probably had, like, 15 funerals by now."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,It's getting annoying.
4,47,Janet,"If it would cheer you up, I could tell you what happened at your original funerals."
4,47,Janet,"Tahani, Moby spoke first."
4,47,Janet,He claimed that --
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Uh, please stop."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't want to hear it.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,What about mine?
4,47,Janet,"Your friends didn't say things about you, so much as they graffitied a Red Lobster about you."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, in Jacksonville, that's the first stage of grief."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In Arizona, you can either have a regular funeral, or they can put your body out on a shooting range, and you get a $200 state tax credit."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hang on.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,This is how we take our minds off the Judge's ruling.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's throw ourselves the funeral to end all funerals.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Awesome!
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"And you know what they say in Florida, ""If you don't like this funeral, just wait a minute."""
4,47,Bad Janet,"Ugh, the Judge's chambers?"
4,47,Bad Janet,I hate this place.
4,47,Bad Janet,What's the WiFi password?
4,47,Bad Janet,There is no service.
4,47,Michael,Shawn.
4,47,Shawn,Michael.
4,47,Michael,Bounces off me and sticks to you.
4,47,Michael,"Wait, no, I messed that up."
4,47,Michael,"First, say something mean to me, really cruel, something that just guts me."
4,47,Michael,You're totally going to be glue.
4,47,Shawn,"So, it's come to this."
4,47,Shawn,We have finally arrived at the end of your pathetic attempt to prove that humans are more than just mobile turd factories.
4,47,Shawn,"And you are going to fail, again, because that is what you do."
4,47,Shawn,"You're a choker, Michael."
4,47,Shawn,And you're about to choke for the last time.
4,47,Shawn,"Except for the eternity you're going to spend in the Bad Place, being choked by me, who will be doing the choking."
4,47,Michael,"Well, you're glue."
4,47,Chuck,Wow!
4,47,Paula,Beautiful!
4,47,Chuck,Look at this place!
4,47,Chuck,The floor!
4,47,Michael,"Hello, Good Place Committee."
4,47,Michael,Thank you for coming.
4,47,Chuck,"No, thank you, Michael."
4,47,Chuck,"You did an incredible job, maybe the best job that anyone's ever done at any task."
4,47,Paula,Mmm.
4,47,Michael,But you don't know how we did.
4,47,Paula,"We might not know how you did, but we know you did great."
4,47,Chuck,"And, Shawn, before we even find out what happened, we want you to know we're willing to give up all of our leverage, compromise and meet you halfway."
4,47,Andie,"Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm."
4,47,Shawn,I met your mom halfway last night.
4,47,Chuck,So colorful!
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We are here to celebrate the afterlife of Tahani Al-Jamil, in the place she felt most comfortable, the cabin of a Gulfstream G650 private jet."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Tahani was super nice, and she deserved for people to be nicer to her than they were."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,The only sad thing is that she never got over her speech impediment.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani improved so much over her many lives, but she also helped me improve."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"She taught me lots of stuff, like ""Bras shouldn't be painful,"" and, ""You don't buy bras at Home Depot,"" and ""They don't sell bras at Home Depot."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What the hell are you wearing?"""
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"For the record, it was a men's back support harness, and it worked in a pinch."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,She was the best friend I ever had and I loved her.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, thank you so much."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was wonderful.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,I wish Chidi was here.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,It sucks that he's too dead for these heaven funerals.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can someone grab his arm?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,My hands are kind of full with his butt.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,How'd he get so jacked?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When he was 14, someone told him that exercise alleviated anxiety."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,He started doing push-ups and basically never stopped.
4,47,Judge,"All right, everyone, let's get this done."
4,47,Judge,"This is the single most important case that has ever appeared in my court, and the results will have ramifications for eternity."
4,47,Judge,"Before we begin, I'm going to need you all to sign this."
4,47,Michael,"""A petition to bring back Ally McBeal""?"
4,47,Judge,"Well, yeah."
4,47,Judge,"I mean, everything else is getting rebooted."
4,47,Judge,"Get a young hottie in there, you know, like a Zendaya type?"
4,47,Judge,Is it Zenday-ah or Zend-iyah?
4,47,Shawn,Zenday-ah.
4,47,Shawn,"Or, I don't"
4,47,Judge,"I mean, who wouldn't watch that?"
4,47,Judge,Am I right?
4,47,Judge,Anyone?
4,47,Judge,"Oh, fine."
4,47,Judge,"Take it away, Matt."
4,47,Matt,"Okay, the moment we've all been waiting for."
4,47,Matt,The test results that dictate the future of humanity.
4,47,Matt,Here we go.
4,47,Matt,"In 30, 29"
4,47,Judge,Ahem.
4,47,Matt," two, one, voila!"
4,47,Matt,I thought this would be fun.
4,47,Matt,Had a lot of time alone in there.
4,47,Michael,Bam!
4,47,Michael,Simone got 12% better than she was on Earth.
4,47,Michael,Bam!
4,47,Michael,Chidi got 26% better.
4,47,Michael,Bam!
4,47,Michael,John got 44% better.
4,47,Michael,Shoot.
4,47,Michael,"Shouldn't have committed so hard to this ""bam"" thing."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Funeral!
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Jason, at the risk of getting an answer that might thoroughly depress me, what made you choose this setting?"
4,47,Jason Mendoza,There's a Jacksonville tradition of having your funeral where you were born.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"I got born in the deep end of a pool, right after my mom did a cannonball."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I knew the risks."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,You never really talk about your mom.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, she died when I was pretty young."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,I lost her to the Big C.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,That's what we called the crocodile that lived by my house.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"I'm just playing, it was cancer."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Watch me do a handstand.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Jason Mendoza didn't have an easy life.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,He once told me the closest he'd ever gotten to having a pinata on his birthday was when a seagull ate too many condoms on the beach and exploded.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But despite it all, he was the most optimistic person I'd ever met."
4,47,Janet,Jason was the very first person to ask me about my feelings.
4,47,Janet,"I hadn't had any yet, but it made me wanna go get some."
4,47,Janet,I could see something special inside him that no one else could see.
4,47,Janet,It was a multi-colored blob of positivity right behind his sternum.
4,47,Janet,"That's my Jason, a big, colorful, rainbow blob, stuffed inside a hot life-size action figure."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, I gotta say, it was nice to have a true dirtbag buddy, so I could talk about what really mattered in life: wrestling, semi-legal drugs and Jason Statham."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Statham forever!
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Indeed.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Statham forever.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Amen.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Amen.
4,47,Michael,Let's focus on the big picture here.
4,47,Michael,"Free of Earth's complications, and its unintended consequences, the other three improved a lot."
4,47,Michael,Chidi got 38% more confident.
4,47,Michael,"Simone got 43% more flexible in her judgments of people, and John didn't call one single person the C-word."
4,47,Judge,"But he did yell the C-word at himself, as well as a pack of squirrels and a chair he tripped over."
4,47,Shawn,Why are we even still discussing this?
4,47,Shawn,Brent got worse.
4,47,Shawn,"If humans can't be good with their needs magically met, maybe they're just not that good."
4,47,Judge,He's right.
4,47,Judge,The evidence needed to be overwhelming.
4,47,Judge,I can't just turn the whole afterlife upside down because three people got a little bit better.
4,47,Michael,"But don't forget, there's a lot of evidence that Eleanor, Jason and Tahani got better in the original experiment, so that's six people."
4,47,Michael,That's the number of friends in Friends.
4,47,Michael,Are you gonna sit there and say that every single Friend belongs in hell?
4,47,Michael,"I mean, maybe Ross and Rachel and Monica and Joey and definitely Chandler but Phoebe?"
4,47,Shawn,"Face it, Michael, you lost."
4,47,Shawn,"Everything you've done, this experiment, the original neighborhood, sending your little cockroach buddies back to Earth, all of it was for nothing."
4,47,Shawn,Bam!
4,47,Shawn,You're glue.
4,47,Michael,"Actually, Shawn, that's a very interesting point."
4,47,Shawn,Exactly.
4,47,Shawn,What?
4,47,Michael,"Matt, call up the active files of four people still alive on Earth."
4,47,Michael,"Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop, and her step-daughter, Patricia, and Steven Peleaz, aka Pillboi."
4,47,Shawn,They were not part of the experiment.
4,47,Shawn,"If he gets to bring random good people into it, I should be able to bring in random bad people."
4,47,Shawn,Call up Elizabeth Holmes.
4,47,Shawn,"No, Henry Kissinger."
4,47,Shawn,No PewDiePie.
4,47,Michael,"Your Honor, the people I wanna look at are not random."
4,47,Michael,"They're four humans the ""cockroaches"" helped on Earth."
4,47,Michael,"No magic, just just kindness."
4,47,Michael,And I bet their emotional support made those four people better.
4,47,Michael,"And if I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say ""we're glue""."
4,47,Judge,I don't think any of you is using that right.
4,47,Judge,"But, fine, let's see it."
4,47,Michael,Look!
4,47,Michael,Right there.
4,47,Michael,"After we intervened, Pillboi dedicated himself to caring for the elderly."
4,47,Michael,Kamilah started a scholarship in Tahani's name that sent 213 women to college.
4,47,Michael,"Donna started doing homework with Patricia every night, and that little girl actually ended up teaching Donna multiplication."
4,47,Michael,Yikes.
4,47,Michael,"Look, the point is people improve when they get external love and support."
4,47,Michael,How can we hold it against them when they don't?
4,47,Shawn,Need I remind you that Brent got worse with every second of every moment of every day.
4,47,Judge,Until right at the end.
4,47,Judge,"With ten seconds left, he swung way up."
4,47,Michael,"This is it, Your Honor."
4,47,Michael,This is the whole story.
4,47,Michael,No one is beyond rehabilitation.
4,47,Michael,Brent spent a year being an absolute diaper load of a human being and the points total tells you that.
4,47,Michael,But what that number can't tell you is who he could've become tomorrow.
4,47,Judge,I'll have my ruling shortly.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, Janet, where do you wanna go for your funeral?"
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Dave & Buster's, probably?"
4,47,Jason Mendoza,You probably want to go to Dave & Buster's.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"I think I heard her say ""Dave & Buster's"", so let's just go there."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,We can sort it out later.
4,47,Janet,"It's nice that you want to honor me, but you've already given me so much."
4,47,Janet,"Tahani taught me that you can make a family, even if you never really had one."
4,47,Janet,Jason taught me that I have value beyond what I do for other people.
4,47,Janet,"And, Eleanor, there was a moment on Earth when all hope was lost, and I watched you have hope anyway."
4,47,Janet,Just thinking about that makes me want to barf up a beautiful quasar.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well said, Janet."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"That means it's your turn, Eleanor."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,All right.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mine's easy.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,We don't even have to move.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I stand here before you, in sweatpants, for the first time ever, to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop in a place where she spent much of her life, a bar in a house she was not invited to."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor was full of surprises.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I never knew if she was going to ruthlessly make fun of me, or totally objectify me in a way that was flattering and also vaguely problematic."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Well
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,But whether she was lifting me up or calling me out I never felt quite so seen as when she saw me.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Eleanor, I know you don't like it when people get all emotional about you, so I channeled all of my love for you into this song."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,That's when the foam cannons go explode outward.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,And then back to the song.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, okay, we're good."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thank you.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who's left?
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,We are here to celebrate the afterlife of Chidi Anagonye.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor, would you like to say a few words?"
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi was a rootin'-tootin'-rackin'-frackin' varmint.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Sorry, I don't know why I just went full Yosemite Sam there."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um yeah, I don't think I can, uh, do this."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I I can't sum up all my feelings about Chidi, so I'm gonna pass."
4,47,Janet,The Judge is about to make her ruling.
4,47,Janet,She wants us to be there to hear it.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, we should probably change outfits."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Tahani's sweatpants say ""Skank Army"" on the butt."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,They do?
4,47,Judge,Michael you came to me and said the points system was flawed.
4,47,Judge,A system that has been in place since the dawn of time and has judged every soul that has ever walked the Earth.
4,47,Judge,And I have come to the conclusion that you're right.
4,47,Michael,I'm
4,47,Judge,You're right.
4,47,Judge,Humans are not fixed at one level of morality.
4,47,Judge,"They can always get better, which means the points system does not accurately judge how good or bad they are."
4,47,Judge,You won.
4,47,Michael,Mmm-hmm.
4,47,Michael,"Well, that wasn't so hard now, was it?"
4,47,Jason Mendoza,We did it!
4,47,Judge,The universe owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing this to my attention.
4,47,Judge,"Now, in terms of how we handle this, moving forward, obviously, Earth is canceled."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, Earth is what now?"
4,47,Judge,"All humans on Earth and in the afterlife will be extinguished, and we will start the entire human race over from scratch."
4,47,Judge,And you know what's so funny?
4,47,Judge,"In a very roundabout way, I am actually rebooting Ally McBeal."
4,47,Judge,Because I'm rebooting everything.
4,47,Judge,"Anyway, congrats, Michael."
4,47,Judge,You won!
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Whoa, whoa."
4,47,Jason Mendoza,"Your Honor, let's just slow down here and say everything again maybe, because I think some of us were thinking about skateboards and don't know what's going on."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Canceling Earth, doesn't that seem a bit drastic?"
4,47,Judge,"It's just too much of a mess down there, you know?"
4,47,Judge,"I mean, the simplest solution is to erase everyone that ever lived and restart with a bunch of amoebas or whatever."
4,47,Judge,"Then human life will evolve again, or maybe even something better."
4,47,Judge,Maybe this time they won't have baby teeth.
4,47,Judge,"You know, that whole thing is so weird."
4,47,Judge,"Like, they fall out, and then the bigger teeth just grow out of that same hole?"
4,47,Judge,Gross.
4,47,Judge,"Anyway, the important thing is, Earth"
4,47,Judge,How are you guys surprised?
4,47,Judge,"I mean, what did you think was gonna happen if you won?"
4,47,Michael,"I don't know, I thought we could just, like, give three points for eating an apple instead of two."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Yes, why can't we just tweak the points a little?"
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Just a you know, a little boost."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Like Spanx, but for your soul."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
4,47,Judge,"Guys, the problem isn't the points, it's that Earth has become too complicated for the points to reflect the value of human behavior."
4,47,Judge,Remember?
4,47,Judge,The whole thing you discovered?
4,47,Judge,And now I have no choice but to fix it.
4,47,Judge,Where did I put that human-wiper-outer thingy?
4,47,Michael,Um
4,47,Judge,"Lip gloss, lip gloss, thing that ends all the wars, Justified Season 2."
4,47,Shawn,Wow.
4,47,Shawn,You won.
4,47,Shawn,And you still somehow failed.
4,47,Shawn,Classic.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wake Chidi up.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Now.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need all the help we can get.
4,47,Michael,You really want me to wake him up just to tell him that he and everyone else in the universe is going to cease to exist?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Not when you say it like that.
4,47,Michael,"Well, what"
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The Good Place nerds, our only hope."
4,47,Michael,"Oh, uh, I don't --"
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yo, yo, yo, angel-types, if you are ever going to do something, you gotta do it now."
4,47,Chuck,"Oh, you bet we're gonna do something."
4,47,Chuck,This has gone too far.
4,47,Bruno,I'm composing some very sternly-worded letters.
4,47,Meg,"Are we sure ""stern"" is the right tone?"
4,47,Meg,We don't want to seem strident.
4,47,Bruno,Yeah.
4,47,Meg,It upsets the norms.
4,47,Bruno,You're absolutely right.
4,47,Bruno,"I apologize and resign, effective immediately."
4,47,Chuck,So bold.
4,47,Chuck,I am so proud of you.
4,47,Judge,Here it is!
4,47,Judge,Great.
4,47,Judge,"Michael, Shawn, Janet, see you in maybe a billion years?"
4,47,Judge,"It has been one crazy ride, you guys."
4,47,Judge,"Oh, I'm gonna miss you guys."
4,47,Judge,Okay.
4,47,Judge,"Bye, y'all."
4,47,Judge,"Janet, what the hell?"
4,47,Judge,Give it back.
4,47,Janet,No.
4,47,Janet,It's in my void and you can't have it.
4,47,Janet,"I don't say ""no"" a lot."
4,47,Janet,Did I pronounce that right?
4,47,Judge,"Janet, you give me back my thingy, or I will go into your void and get it myself."
4,47,Janet,I'd like to see you try.
4,47,Janet,Oh.
4,47,Janet,"Okay, she's trying right now."
4,47,Janet,She's in my void.
4,47,Janet,It feels it feels weird.
4,47,Janet,Yeah --
4,47,Janet,"Yikes, whoa."
4,47,Janet,Okay.
4,47,Judge,"Real cute, honey."
4,47,Judge,Where is it?
4,47,Janet,What do you mean?
4,47,Janet,It's not in my void?
4,47,Bad Janet,No.
4,47,Bad Janet,It's in mine.
4,47,Bad Janet,"Ugh, I feel like such a weiner hole saying this, but Michael wrote a manifesto, and I read it on the toilet."
4,47,Bad Janet,I don't have to poop.
4,47,Bad Janet,I choose to.
4,47,Bad Janet,"Anyway, I'm with them now."
4,47,Shawn,Are you kidding me?
4,47,Bad Janet,"Oh, get over yourself, you dork."
4,47,Bad Janet,The whole system is royally effed.
4,47,Bad Janet,"Humans suck, but this isn't their fault."
4,47,Michael,You read what I wrote?
4,47,Michael,And it got through to you?
4,47,Bad Janet,"Yeah, but I also used the pages to wipe my butt, so don't pop a stiffy just yet."
4,47,Bad Janet,M'kay?
4,47,Janet,I am so proud of you.
4,47,Bad Janet,I don't care.
4,47,Janet,I think you do a little bit.
4,47,Janet,Sister hug!
4,47,Bad Janet,"Yeah, okay."
4,47,Bad Janet,Get off me.
4,47,Bad Janet,"Ew, ew, ew, ew."
4,47,Judge,Hey!
4,47,Judge,Listen up.
4,47,Judge,I made an official ruling and I am not going to see it undone by two Janets playing keep-away.
4,47,Bad Janet,"Oh, I should've explained."
4,47,Bad Janet,It's not two of us.
4,47,Bad Janet,It's all of us.
4,47,Good Janet Ensemble,Hi.
4,47,Bad Janet Ensemble,"What up, nerds?"
4,47,Bad Janet Ensemble,"Eat my farts, losers."
4,47,Neutral Janet Ensemble,I am entering for a reason and no other reason.
4,47,Bad Janet Ensemble,"What up, fart-knockers?"
4,47,Good Janet Ensemble,Hi!
4,47,Good Janet Ensemble,Hello.
4,47,Disco Janet Ensemble,"What it is, what it is!"
4,47,Bad Janet Ensemble,"What up, dorks."
4,47,Bad Janet,Sent the manifesto around to all the other Janets.
4,47,Bad Janet,We have a group text now.
4,47,Good Janet Ensemble,I mostly send GIFs of otters!
4,47,Judge,This is so annoying!
4,47,Judge,"Okay, Janets, you want to do this the hard way?"
4,47,Judge,"I am gonna search your voids one by one, and then marbleize you one by one, until I get my stupid Earth rebooter thingy back."
4,47,Good Janet,We're not gonna be able to hold her off forever.
4,47,Good Janet,We need a plan.
4,47,Michael,Okay.
4,47,Michael,"So, what's the plan?"
4,47,Michael,"Plan, plan, plan."
4,47,Michael,"Step one, get a plan."
4,47,Michael,"Step two, do the plan."
4,47,Michael,"Yeah, this is working."
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Michael.
4,47,Tahani Al-Jamil,Focus.
4,47,Michael,Right.
4,47,Michael,Sorry.
4,47,Michael,"Uh, all right, so if we can't change the points, then maybe we can change what we do with the points."
4,47,Michael,"Yeah, we just need a brand-new system for judging humans in the afterlife."
4,47,Michael,"We can do this, right?"
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But in order to crack it, I think you know what needs to happen."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,There is literally only one person here who is smart enough and thoughtful enough to save humanity.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,Fine.
4,47,Jason Mendoza,I'll do it.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not you, dummy."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Designing a better afterlife is the ultimate ethical question.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Chidi spent his entire existence pondering the biggest questions.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,He is brilliant and empathetic.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,All he cares about is how best to treat other people and he is willing to sacrifice his own happiness to do it.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If we're gonna pull this off, we need Chidi back."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,And he needs his memories.
4,47,Michael,"You want to take the most indecisive man ever born, stuff him full of over 800 different versions of himself, and then tell him he has, like, what, 45 minutes to save humanity?"
4,47,Michael,You think that will go well?
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know how it's gonna go, but he is our only chance."
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,And it is now or literally never.
4,47,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wake him up.
4,47,Judge,Not in this Janet.
4,47,Judge,Next!
4,48,Judge,Not in this Janet.
4,48,Judge,Next!
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you waiting for?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Do it.
4,48,Michael,It's not that easy.
4,48,Michael,"He lived a whole life, and then 802 afterlives, then a second life, then a second afterlife, then a third first afterlife his psyche's like a giant bowl of M&M Peep chili."
4,48,Michael,"I gotta make sure all the memories go in the right place, in the right order."
4,48,Michael,Maybe I just start him at the beginning.
4,48,Michael,A full factory reset.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Man.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, can I please have a drink with a lot of alcohol in it?"
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"Here, I saved this from my funeral."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,It's called a Duval Ditchwater.
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"It's Midori, Coffee-Mate and ditch water!"
4,48,Janet,I'll get you a margarita.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, that sounds better."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,It's not!
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"Seriously, try this."
4,48,Michael,"Okay, here we go."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Whoa --
4,48,Ndeye,Ooh.
4,48,Emeka,He has your eyes.
4,48,Ndeye,And your smile.
4,48,Ndeye,"Now, he just needs a name."
4,48,Emeka,Big decision.
4,48,Emeka,How about Chidi?
4,48,Ndeye,"Oh, I like that."
4,48,Ndeye,"Do you like it, Chidi?"
4,48,Ndeye,Or would you like a different name?
4,48,Ndeye,Oh.
4,48,Ndeye,Looks like he has a tummyache.
4,48,Emeka,Oh.
4,48,Ndeye,Chidi.
4,48,Emeka,You're not listening to me.
4,48,Emeka,Everything always has to be your way.
4,48,Ndeye,And what is the one right way then?
4,48,Ndeye,"I mean, how many times have I told you this?"
4,48,Emeka,I thought this is what you wanted.
4,48,Ndeye,No!
4,48,Ndeye,It's obviously what you want.
4,48,Ndeye,You're just angry that your book was rejected.
4,48,Emeka,How dare you bring that up again?
4,48,Ndeye,You're always at the university.
4,48,Ndeye,How about you show some interest in someone who didn't die 200 years ago?
4,48,Emeka,I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
4,48,Emeka,We need to go back to Nigeria.
4,48,Ndeye,"No, we are not going back."
4,48,Ndeye,My family is here and we did this for your career.
4,48,Emeka,Oh.
4,48,Emeka,"Good morning, Chidi."
4,48,Ndeye,Would you like some breakfast?
4,48,Young Chidi,I have a presentation.
4,48,Young Chidi,Here's the syllabus.
4,48,Young Chidi,Take one and pass them on.
4,48,Young Chidi,My lecture will take approximately 55 minutes.
4,48,Young Chidi,"Let's begin, shall we?"
4,48,Young Chidi,"In conclusion, there is one clear answer, and it's that the two of you should stay married."
4,48,Young Chidi,Questions?
4,48,Ndeye,That was clear and persuasive.
4,48,Ndeye,And you have made a strong case.
4,48,Emeka,"Yes, well-argued."
4,48,Emeka,Better than some of my grad students.
4,48,Emeka,You should get ready for school.
4,48,Emeka,I'll take you.
4,48,Ndeye,We'll both take you.
4,48,Young Uzo,It worked?
4,48,Young Chidi,Perfectly.
4,48,Young Chidi,"They're happy again, Uzo."
4,48,Young Chidi,They're even talking about getting me a puppy.
4,48,Young Chidi,"But more importantly, I proved once and for all that you can always find the answer."
4,48,Young Uzo,The answer to what?
4,48,Young Chidi,To anything.
4,48,Young Chidi,Every problem has an answer.
4,48,Young Chidi,"If you just read enough books and think hard enough, you can figure out the answer to any question."
4,48,Young Uzo,"I know you're really smart, but that sounds wrong."
4,48,Rokhaya,Children?
4,48,Rokhaya,Please take your seats.
4,48,Young Chidi,Here's a perfect example.
4,48,Young Chidi,Where to sit?
4,48,Young Chidi,What's the answer?
4,48,Young Chidi,"Obviously, we want to be back by the pencil sharpener, but in the front, I can see the blackboard better, or by the door to get a nice breeze?"
4,48,Rokhaya,Chidi?
4,48,Young Chidi,Just hang on.
4,48,Young Chidi,Sorry.
4,48,Young Chidi,"Oh, no."
4,48,Emeka,I still say Professor Lindeman was a fool to abandon Chidi.
4,48,Emeka,He has a brilliant mind.
4,48,Emeka,"One day, he will use it to solve the world's biggest problems."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Is this enough cheese?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I hope this is enough cheese.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"There's sheep, goat and cow's milk."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I can run and get more.
4,48,Allesandra,"Oh, no, this is plenty of cheese."
4,48,Allesandra,"I have to ask, has Chidi always been so thoughtful?"
4,48,Emeka,Ever since he was a child.
4,48,Emeka,I'm sure you've heard about his first great lecture?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, no, not that old story again."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,It's so embarrassing.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Go ahead.
4,48,Ndeye,"A long time ago, Emeka and I were going through a rough patch."
4,48,Ndeye,"And our little Chidi, at eight years old, comes in with a one-hour lecture."
4,48,Emeka,All about why we should stay married.
4,48,Emeka,"And all these years later, here we still are."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,It's the reason I got into philosophy.
4,48,Allesandra,Hmm.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,The biggest questions and the biggest answers.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You just gotta find them.
4,48,Allesandra,"I mean, I love philosophy, too."
4,48,Allesandra,"But I'd argue that, say, theoretical physics presents bigger questions than philosophy."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Wait, do you really think that?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Should I switch to physics?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, obviously, my parents loved you."
4,48,Allesandra,I'm so glad.
4,48,Allesandra,They're great.
4,48,Allesandra,We have to break up.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh wait, wait."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Why?
4,48,Allesandra,I've been feeling this way for a while now.
4,48,Allesandra,It's just why are we together?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Because it it makes sense.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you like Kant, I like Kant"
4,48,Allesandra,We're not a book group.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, we're not not a book group."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, if there's a problem with our relationship, there is an answer that will solve it."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, let's hit the library."
4,48,Allesandra,You wanna use philosophy?
4,48,Allesandra,How about David Hume?
4,48,Allesandra,"""Reason is and ought only to be a slave to the passions."""
4,48,Allesandra,"You know, emotions, desires, feelings."
4,48,Allesandra,Do you have any of those?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Of course I have feelings.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I have strong feelings for for you and what we have.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"And right now, I will show you how Kant refuted most of Hume's central theses."
4,48,Allesandra,"Oh, my God."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, what do you think?"
4,48,Professor Radja,"I think it's 3,600 pages."
4,48,Professor Radja,"I have a job, Chidi."
4,48,Professor Radja,I have a family.
4,48,Professor Radja,"Until I had to read this, I had a will to live."
4,48,Professor Radja,"This work is an insane, tangled web of inscrutability."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"In the fun, ""grad students will analyze this for centuries"" way?"
4,48,Professor Radja,"No, in the Unabomber way."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, um, I'll write my way out of the maze."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I'll re-outline the middle chapters, do more research --"
4,48,Professor Radja,"No, Chidi!"
4,48,Professor Radja,You can't answer every question every philosopher has ever asked.
4,48,Professor Radja,"So, what in these pages do you care about?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,All of it.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Equally.
4,48,Professor Radja,Shut up!
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,But --
4,48,Professor Radja,Shut up!
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Should I --
4,48,Professor Radja,Shut up!
4,48,Professor Radja,Shut up!
4,48,Professor Radja,The greatest works of moral philosophy are emotional.
4,48,Professor Radja,They make an argument about how the world is and ought to be.
4,48,Professor Radja,"There is a great mind at work in here, but where is the heart?"
4,48,Professor Radja,Where are the guts?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I understand.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I do.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I'm going to go home, and compose a short paper for you, arguing that I should continue working on this longer paper."
4,48,Professor Radja,Shut up!
4,48,Uzo,Wow.
4,48,Uzo,Tough week.
4,48,Uzo,"Sorry, pal."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Honestly, I don't know what hurts more, my thesis meeting or Allesandra."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"She was brilliant, and funny I thought that maybe she was the answer."
4,48,Uzo,Some things in life don't have an answer.
4,48,Uzo,Isn't that what Allesandra was saying?
4,48,Uzo,"Isn't that what your advisor said, too?"
4,48,Uzo,Isn't that what everyone who knows you has said to you at every waking moment of your life?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, I can figure this out."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I just need to find the answer for how to impress Allesandra, a separate answer for how to impress my advisor or, ideally, one answer for how to impress them both."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, you know what this calls for?"
4,48,Uzo,Don't say it.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,A Venn diagram.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,48,Uzo,No Venn diagram.
4,48,Uzo,"If you won't listen to other people, do you at least hear what you're saying?"
4,48,Uzo,"I swear, sometimes it is literally impossible to be your friend."
4,48,Uzo,You're incapable of making a single decision.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect"
4,48,Michael,Chidi?
4,48,Michael,Come on in.
4,48,Michael,Unless you'd be more comfortable out here?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I feel like you want me to"
4,48,Michael,"I'll tell you what, I'll decide for you."
4,48,Michael,Come on in.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Great.
4,48,Michael,Watch this.
4,48,Michael,Your fridge chooses your breakfast for you.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Oatmeal and almond milk.
4,48,Michael,Extra filmy.
4,48,Michael,You don't even have to decide.
4,48,Michael,It just knows what you want.
4,48,Michael,And for all your other requests Janet?
4,48,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,48,Michael,Janet knows the answers to all the questions in the universe.
4,48,Michael,Ask her anything.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Which answer do I want?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Something profound, obviously."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Shouldn't be trivial or salacious.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Or maybe I should start small, maybe ramp up."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I or I can't
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,What's the biggest fish?
4,48,Janet,The whale shark.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Cool.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sorry.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I'll have better questions later.
4,48,Janet,"You don't need to apologize, Chidi."
4,48,Janet,All questions are equally important to me.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, then, you and I are gonna get along great."
4,48,Michael,I need to go welcome some more residents.
4,48,Michael,Are there any other questions I can answer for you before I go?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, yes."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Is there a relationship equivalent to the oatmeal?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh is there like a, sort of"
4,48,Michael,Soulmate?
4,48,Michael,Yes.
4,48,Michael,Every person in the Good Place has one perfect match.
4,48,Michael,"In an hour, come on by the little house that looks like a face, and get the answer to your ultimate question."
4,48,Michael,Her name's Eleanor.
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Remember this?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah!
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, that was eight minutes ago."
4,48,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, you just proposed to Janet, and you said yes, and now you're married."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Mmm-hmm.
4,48,Janet,Mmm-hmm.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, I thought saying that out loud would make it less insane, but it did not."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"Thanks, homie."
4,48,Janet,"If you'd like to get us a present, we're registered at me."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, Jason, I I think I need your help."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Can I ask you something?
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Whoa.
4,48,Jason Mendoza,No one's ever asked me for advice before.
4,48,Jason Mendoza,And you're a high school principal.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,College professor.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Who who told you how to do this?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, how can you just make a decision this big?"
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"Chidi, here's the thing with stuff."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"You can look at a problem from every angle and drive yourself crazy, but sometimes you just gotta huck a Molotov cocktail at a drone and see what happens."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Is what happens that the drone blows up?
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Usually.
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, where I'm from, most things blow up eventually."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"So I learned that when something dope comes along, you gotta lock it down."
4,48,Jason Mendoza,"If you're always frozen in fear, and taking too long to think about what to do, you'll miss your opportunity, and maybe get sucked into the propeller of a swamp boat."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I just I don't think I'll ever be the kind of person who just acts.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, I can't just open a door and walk through without knowing what's on the other side."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Even with eternity to try, I just don't think that can happen."
4,48,Janet,"Well, I never thought I'd ever be able to get married."
4,48,Janet,I thought I was too old.
4,48,Janet,"I'm infinity, but strange things happen in the afterlife."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,We figured it out once.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can do it again.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because you know what, Michael?"
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ya basic --
4,48,Michael,"This is your soulmate, Salamasina."
4,48,Michael,"Meet your soulmate, Guan-yin."
4,48,Michael,Tahani.
4,48,Michael,Karen.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Esmerelda, you don't bring knives to a friendly game night."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, who does that?"
4,48,Esmeralda,The prepared.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Chidi, Esmerelda, it's your turn!"
4,48,Esmeralda,Blood.
4,48,Esmeralda,Seas of blood.
4,48,Esmeralda,Enemies.
4,48,Esmeralda,Uh a thousand years of darkness.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Uh nightmares.
4,48,Esmeralda,Blood.
4,48,Esmeralda,Ennui?
4,48,Esmeralda,Lamenting the inexorable passage of time.
4,48,Esmeralda,Fire and blood.
4,48,Esmeralda,Ugh!
4,48,Esmeralda,You fool.
4,48,Esmeralda,"It was ""birthday parties""."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"""Birthday parties""?"
4,48,Esmeralda,These trivialities demean me.
4,48,Esmeralda,I must away and tend to my ravens.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, you never know what'll happen at game night."
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's continue.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,I think I can find you another partner.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Tahani, thank you so much."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,That ended up being one of the best nights I've had since we got here.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,You and Eleanor made a good pair.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,You two really tore through that round of charades.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, I'm pretty sure she was reading the cards off the reflection in my glasses, but, yeah, that was amazing."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Um can I ask you something?
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hmm.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Tonight could've been a real disaster.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,How do you have the confidence to just swoop in and so elegantly take charge of a whole group of strangers?
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Honestly, the confidence comes from failure."
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've thrown my fair share of disastrous gatherings.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,Remind me to tell you someday about Timothee Chalamet's bar mitzvah.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,But you live through the failure and you learn from it.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I just I can't operate that way."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I can't make a decision unless I'm sure I'm right.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Chidi."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're a philosophy professor, right?"
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Any chance you'd want to grab a drink and talk about ethics?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's a subject I've recently needed to learn about, immediately."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Sounds great.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, let me get my coat."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Awesome.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"By the way, I wasn't cheating before or eavesdropping just now."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoo!
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When we started three months ago, I never thought I'd get so into philosophy that we'd study past midnight."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Esmerelda must be wondering where her soulmate is.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Ah.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,She's off in her aviary.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Sometimes, I think her ravens are her real soulmate."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I'm not kidding, actually."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You should see her with them.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,It's intense.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"And if I'm being honest, sexually charged."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Anyways.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Um this has been fun as always --
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Uh what was why did you who was it?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I'll take those one at a time, I guess."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Um it was a kiss.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did it because I wanted to.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And as far as who it was, it was me, weirdo."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, I I have a soulmate."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, and you're not into her at all."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, come on."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,There is no way you're supposed to spend eternity with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, I know she and I are in a rough patch, but we just have to find the answer for how to get out of it."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Like my parents.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You remember that story I told you about my parents?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I don't think that story is as cute as you think it is, man."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, I'm sure you were cute, you know, big melon head and a little necktie."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,But that moment?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Woof, that's too much to put on an eight-year-old."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I kinda wish cute little Chidi just got to be a kid, rather than a miniature professor trying to solve all the world's problems."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, but living that way led me to philosophy."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"And, sure, I was written up in a medical journal as the youngest person ever with a stress-induced ulcer, but I got into the Good Place."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second to think about what I owe my universe-approved soulmate, and not just, uh, make out with you."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, man."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Kiss rescinded.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We'll just study, like two platonic nerds, until Michael discovers me, or until Esmerelda turns me into a toad with her magic amulet, because she can see that we're obviously into each other."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sorry you got an actual human being instead of your true soulmate a library cart full of damp saltines.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You are unbelievable.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I don't know what I did to deserve you.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Believe it, baby."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm all yours.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,At least until something better comes along.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,For me.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,You've pretty much topped out.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,You okay?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,No!
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I have to give Michael a new draft of my thesis and I'm a mess.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Will you help me?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,Woof!
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,You want my help with philosophy?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,You must be in rough shape.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, yes, of course."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm here for you.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,What do you need?
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think I need it to be you.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"There's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again, here, on this plane of existence, uh, today, now."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We found each other before, hundreds of times."
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,We can do it again.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Bye, Chidi."
4,48,Michael,You're sure you want to do this?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I finally make up my mind about one damn thing and you try to talk me out of it?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I'm sure.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Can I ask you a question?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Soulmates aren't real, are they?"
4,48,Michael,"Chidi, in all honesty, I don't know."
4,48,Michael,But I don't think so.
4,48,Michael,I knew what you expected to find when you got here: answers.
4,48,Michael,"Also, if I recall from your file, a magic blackboard?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,One that anticipates your lesson flow.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,That is the dream.
4,48,Michael,But mostly you wanted answers.
4,48,Michael,"The ""soulmate"" one in particular."
4,48,Michael,"So, I used it to torture you."
4,48,Michael,"Which, again, sorry."
4,48,Michael,"If soulmates do exist, they're they're not found, they're made."
4,48,Michael,"People meet, they get a good feeling and then they get to work, building a relationship."
4,48,Michael,Like your parents.
4,48,Michael,They didn't magically stay together because you proved they should.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,It wasn't my logic or my presentation.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"It was the feeling they got watching me, this scared little kid, telling them that he needed them."
4,48,Michael,And it was also what you made them remember.
4,48,Michael,They loved each other.
4,48,Michael,"Sometimes, people forget."
4,48,Michael,You reminded them of what they already had.
4,48,Michael,It convinced them to go to counseling.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I never knew they went to counseling.
4,48,Michael,"Yeah, kids are idiots."
4,48,Michael,"If they knew half the stuff their folks were up to, they'd lose their minds."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Turns out, life isn't a puzzle that can just be solved one time and it's done."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You wake up every day and you solve it again.
4,48,Michael,Terribly inefficient.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Ah, what a time to learn."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Can you give me a second?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Janet?
4,48,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, can I have a pen and some paper?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't know if I'll see you again, or what I'll remember if I do, but if we do cross paths again, sometime, somewhere can you get this back to me?"
4,48,Janet,Of course.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I'm ready.
4,48,Michael,"Hi, there, Chidi."
4,48,Michael,Welcome back.
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is he all right?
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did you break him?
4,48,Michael,"Hey, buddy."
4,48,Michael,How you doing?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Man, I'm doin' great."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, so, for the past 300 years, have I been super annoying?"
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no"
4,48,Michael,"No, I wouldn't say no, no."
4,48,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, not extremely"
4,48,Jason Mendoza,Yes.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, thank you, all of you, for everything that you've done for me."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,You are wonderful people.
4,48,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, man, that's great, but, um, listen, we have, like, one hour to create an entirely new afterlife and, uh, also save all of humanity, and we were wondering if you could do your Chidi thing and um find us the answer?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, Eleanor, this kind of thing doesn't have just one answer."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,There might be 800.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,There could be zero.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Who knows?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"You know, the journey is the destination, right?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Let's get to work.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,Can you give me one second?
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, uh, Janet?"
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"Can I have my note, please?"
4,48,Janet,If you know that you wrote a note then you know what it says.
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,"I do, uh, but I'd still like to see it again, please."
4,48,Chidi Anagonye,I think it might be some of the best writing I've ever done.
4,49,Judge,Ugh.
4,49,Judge,"All Janet voids are nothing, but Neutral Janet voids are, like, the most nothing."
4,49,Janet,"Judge, please, please don't cancel Earth."
4,49,Judge,Why not?
4,49,Judge,The system's broken.
4,49,Judge,You guys proved it.
4,49,Judge,I just wanna reboot the whole thing and go back to my chambers.
4,49,Judge,"I am on Season Three of Justified, and can I just tell you, it is so good!"
4,49,Judge,"I, like, binged all of Season Two in a day."
4,49,Janet,Think of all the amazing human achievement you'd be eliminating.
4,49,Janet,"Uh, the works of William Shakespeare, the pyramids, Timothy Olyphant"
4,49,Judge,"Oh, that one stings."
4,49,Judge,There's like 50 gallons of man in a ten-gallon hat.
4,49,Judge,"I'm like ""Ooh""!"
4,49,Judge,"Look, I'm the frickin' Judge, and I made a frickin' ruling, and it's gonna frickin' happen, as soon as I find the frickin' clicker thing!"
4,49,Judge,"All right, what do I search for?"
4,49,Judge,"""Humanity eraser button garage door opener thingy Judge."""
4,49,Judge,Ugh!
4,49,Judge,"Well, it wasn't in you."
4,49,Judge,Any last words?
4,49,Neutral Janet,These are my last words.
4,49,Neutral Janet,End of words.
4,49,Judge,Yes.
4,49,Judge,Really boring.
4,49,Judge,Bye!
4,49,Judge,"All right, who's next?"
4,49,Bad Janet,"Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink."
4,49,Judge,"That is so interesting, because last time I checked, I didn't have a dad."
4,49,Judge,That's why I'm attracted to all the father figures on the TV shows I watch.
4,49,Judge,M'kay?
4,49,Janet,We can't play keep-away forever.
4,49,Michael,Keep trying.
4,49,Michael,Get her to see the light.
4,49,Janet,I already showed her the light.
4,49,Janet,She wasn't impressed.
4,49,Janet,"To be fair, she was there when it was invented."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, bud."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Hi!
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know you're trying to think of ways to save every soul who's ever lived and whatnot, but um, we may only have a half hour left to exist, so I just wanted to check in with you, vis-a-vis us."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, yeah, cool."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,I love you.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoa!
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,I love you.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"So, uh, do you love me?"
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, I do."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, then, cool!"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,You and I are on our way to Coolsville.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You seem oddly sure, which is unlike you, but it's kind of doing it for me."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Should we get out of here?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, but I like the confidence."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, well, when you have 1,000 different versions of yourself over multiple timelines fused and instantly placed into your consciousness, it gives you a real sense of clarity."
4,49,Michael,"You saw the Time Knife, huh?"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Yep, saw the Time Knife."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,It was neat.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Okay!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Let's save humanity, shall we?"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard and a copy of Judith Shklar's Ordinary Vices?
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,And and maybe some warm pretzels?
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"If we goin' out, I'm goin' out with a belly full of warm pretzels."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Yummy, yum-yum."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Yummy!
4,49,Michael,"Okay, before we try to completely redesign the entire afterlife, has anyone just thought of a good reason the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?"
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Because it would be a bummer.
4,49,Michael,Yeah.
4,49,Michael,We might need more than that.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Are you at least gonna write it down?
4,49,Michael,"Yeah, all right."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Did you actually write it down or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,We need to think bigger.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We need to come up with an entirely new afterlife system that both the Good and Bad Place agree on, which seems impossible."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,Nonsense.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,Compromise is always possible.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars, LeBron James and Dr. Ruth Westheimer --"
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We don't have time for this right now, babe."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fine.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Long story short, LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy, the song won multiple Grammys and everyone was really happy."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, now I wanna hear the story."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, you're right."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's focus.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"So, in this essay, ""Putting Cruelty First"", Judith Shklar contends that we should consider cruelty as society's primary flaw."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,I got 'em from Disco Janet.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Thanks, Disco Janet!"
4,49,Disco Janet,Solid!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Anyway, here's her point."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Imagine someone sells a joint and then gets locked away in a dangerous prison for years.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"The crime isn't cruel, but the punishment is."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,That's a problem.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Tell me about it.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,I once went to jail for a week just because I stole a hot dog.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Well, a hot dog-shaped car."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,I stole the Wienermobile.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,This is the problem with the current system.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Live anything less than the most exemplary life, and you are brutally tortured forever, with no recourse."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,The cruelty of the punishment does not match the cruelty of the life that one has lived.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Now, watch this spin."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we need to come up with a system that will result in the least amount of cruelty and suffering to those who don't deserve it."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,This is a problem of justice.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Hearing you talk about philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,You wanna get out of here?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, keep going."
4,49,Judge,Ugh!
4,49,Judge,Bad Janet voids are the worst.
4,49,Judge,Music off.
4,49,Judge,"Oh, right."
4,49,Judge,I forgot.
4,49,Judge,Make it louder.
4,49,Janet,What if you start humanity over from scratch and humans evolve over millions of years and they end up worse?
4,49,Janet,What if they invent rap rock sooner and it becomes the only kind of music?
4,49,Janet,"Do you really want to oversee an entire world of Limp Bizkits, run by Emperor Kid Rock?"
4,49,Judge,Not my problem.
4,49,Judge,"All right, here we go."
4,49,Judge,"""Software update""?"
4,49,Judge,No.
4,49,Judge,Cancel.
4,49,Judge,Why is it doing it now?
4,49,Judge,"Argh, this computer sucks."
4,49,Judge,"Okay, mama."
4,49,Judge,See you in the next life.
4,49,Bad Janet,"Before you marbleize me, can I just make one final statement to summarize how I really feel?"
4,49,Judge,I think I know where this is going.
4,49,Judge,"Okay, Disco Janet."
4,49,Judge,You're up.
4,49,Disco Janet,Outta sight.
4,49,Judge,What are you guys still doing here?
4,49,Judge,"Just go back to Mindy's and have a lukewarm beer, and wait for me to end you there."
4,49,Judge,"Except for you, cookie-puss."
4,49,Judge,I'll always make room for you.
4,49,Michael,Wait a second that's it.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,I agree.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Chidi should hook up with the Judge to get us out of trouble.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,I've done that a bunch of times.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,It's called a Jacksonville Plea Bargain.
4,49,Michael,No.
4,49,Michael,Mindy's house.
4,49,Michael,"Eleanor always thought there should be a a Medium Place, for people who led medium lives."
4,49,Michael,That's the answer.
4,49,Michael,We make the Medium Place a third option.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Of course!
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe if you score negative points on Earth, um ""Sorry, ya blew it."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Enjoy having your penis flattened."""
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Over a million or whatever party time!
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And everyone else in between gets their own, personal Cincinnati."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"It's definitely less cruel than the current system, but it's not great."
4,49,Michael,"It might be the best we can do, given the circumstances."
4,49,Michael,Let's try to sell it to the brass.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, all."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thought since the universe is ending, you'd be less cheery."
4,49,Meg,Hard not to be cheery when you're eating this delicious frozen yogurt.
4,49,Chuck,I got a small amount of each flavor.
4,49,Chuck,It's the only way to ensure a mouthful of compromise.
4,49,Meg,You are so right.
4,49,Daisuke,Well said!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Shut up.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Shut up.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Hi.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Shut up.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,I'm confident now.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, sorry."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're just short on time.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Look, we um, have a new idea about how humans could be placed in the afterlife --"
4,49,Chuck,We love it.
4,49,Chuck,We're in.
4,49,Michael,You don't even want to hear it?
4,49,Chuck,Nope.
4,49,Chuck,"If you guys came up with it, it must be good."
4,49,Paula,"Oh, yeah."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Guys, they said yes."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's take the win.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, all we have to do is convince Shawn."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll take the lead.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If I can convince Dr. Ruth not to sue Bruno Mars over songwriting credit on ""Uptown Funk"", I can handle this."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, you gotta tell me that story on the way."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, anyone who doesn't meet the threshold for the new Medium Place neighborhood is yours for the taking."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,The Bad Place still has plenty of people to torture.
4,49,Shawn,"I have to admit, this does make sense, and I like that your side is settling for a crappy deal, while my side stays mostly the same."
4,49,Shawn,What the hell?
4,49,Shawn,I'm in.
4,49,Michael,Really?
4,49,Shawn,No!
4,49,Shawn,You actually believed me?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Dude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity is going to be erased forever."
4,49,Shawn,And?
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"The Bad Place will get emptied out, too."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,You will have no one to torture for billions of years.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,Everyone loses.
4,49,Shawn,"Oh, I know, but here's the thing."
4,49,Shawn,"I don't care if everyone loses, as long as you lose."
4,49,Michael,"Shawn, listen to reason."
4,49,Shawn,Why should I?
4,49,Shawn,None of this would have happened if you hadn't mucked around with your neighborhood and your new ideas.
4,49,Shawn,New ideas are gross.
4,49,Shawn,They sicken me.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Shawn, you used to be cool, but you've changed, man."
4,49,Shawn,I'm gonna go write an evil speech for when this is all over.
4,49,Shawn,It is gonna be so long.
4,49,Judge,You can ring my bell.
4,49,Judge,Whoo!
4,49,Judge,Wait a second.
4,49,Judge,What was I doing?
4,49,Janet,I'll tell ya what you were doing.
4,49,Janet,You were tearin' up the dance floor.
4,49,Judge,No.
4,49,Judge,I was looking for the stupid clicker thingy.
4,49,Judge,Gah!
4,49,Judge,Those infectious disco grooves!
4,49,Janet,"So, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
4,49,Janet,We have this amazing new idea and Shawn is almost on board.
4,49,Janet,"Maybe if you talked to him, you could nudge him towards an agreement."
4,49,Judge,I don't take sides.
4,49,Judge,I am the Judge.
4,49,Judge,My only concerns are fairness and impartiality.
4,49,Judge,"Gonna erase the Earth, erase the Earth."
4,49,Judge,That song is really my jam.
4,49,Judge,Humanity eraser thingy.
4,49,Judge,"Well, later, skater."
4,49,Disco Janet,Keep on truckin'.
4,49,Judge,Next!
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Even for a demon, Shawn is being a real knob."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Guys, I know what we have to offer him to get him to change his mind."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Something he wants.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Once we figure that out, we're golden."
4,49,Michael,It's pointless.
4,49,Michael,He's so focused on beating us that he's willing to burn everything down.
4,49,Michael,There's nothing we can offer him.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Actually, there is something he wants."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cruelty.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, let's give it to him."
4,49,Shawn,"Oh, hey, guys."
4,49,Shawn,Just smashing some stuff.
4,49,Shawn,What's up?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Listen, demon."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,We know how much you want us to lose.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we volunteer to lose, permanently."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,If you agree to let the Judge establish a real Medium Place you can torture the four of us forever.
4,49,Shawn,Really?
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,This is a classic trolley problem.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"One of your boys sets off a stink-bomb on the trolley, causing a commotion, so the rest of the crew can pickpocket people as they run off the train."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"That's very wrong, but in a roundabout way, you kinda got where you needed to be."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'll even give you a head start on my torture.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,I cannot pull off the mod look.
4,49,Michael,"You can take me, too."
4,49,Michael,I couldn't live with myself knowing you four were down there without me.
4,49,Shawn,Wow!
4,49,Shawn,This is a toughie.
4,49,Shawn,"On one hand, I would love to get some spiders in those buttholes."
4,49,Shawn,"On the other, there'd be billions of buttholes going completely un-spidered."
4,49,Shawn,How about this: everyone who dies goes to the Bad Place and I get to torture all of you?
4,49,Meg,Sounds good to us.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, dummies."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's already how it works, except we're also tortured."
4,49,Shawn,"Look, I put forward a proposal."
4,49,Shawn,Are you not even going to negotiate?
4,49,Chuck,He's got a point.
4,49,Chuck,"The fair thing for us to do is just keep on giving up more and more stuff we want, unilaterally, until this demon is finally happy."
4,49,Michael,Fork this!
4,49,Michael,"If we're gonna lose, let's lose on our own terms."
4,49,Michael,Let's come up with a completely new idea that actually makes the universe better.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Amen.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,At least then we can hold our heads high.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, we need to come up with our ideal plan in about ten minutes."
4,49,Michael,"Guys, it's all come to this."
4,49,Michael,"Everything we've been through, the multiple lives you led on Earth, all the lives you led here, all the ethics training and lessons, and journeys to the farthest corners of the afterlife, all happened so that we could be here, together, as the very best versions of ourselves, to solve the ultimate problem in the nick of time."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cool speech.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, it's nine minutes."
4,49,Michael,"Chidi, can you do this?"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, what you just said, ""the very best versions of ourselves"", gave me an idea."
4,49,Michael,Ha!
4,49,Michael,Turns out it was a cool speech.
4,49,Judge,"Not in you, either."
4,49,Bad Janet,I just have one thing left to say.
4,49,Judge,Beh-beh-beh.
4,49,Bad Janet,No --
4,49,Judge,Not falling for that again.
4,49,Judge,Man.
4,49,Judge,She is committed.
4,49,Judge,That just leaves you.
4,49,Michael,"Your Honor, we have an idea we'd like to present."
4,49,Judge,"Not interested, stretch."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,How can we convince her of our plan if she won't even listen?
4,49,Janet,"Well, if she's not gonna stay out here, you gotta go in there."
4,49,Michael,But that didn't really work great last time.
4,49,Janet,"Yeah, it wasn't amazing, but she's gonna marbleize me in, like, two minutes, so we might as well try."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are we all gonna be you, again?"
4,49,Janet,I don't think so.
4,49,Janet,Going through that once changed me and all of you.
4,49,Michael,"But if the Judge wasn't going to listen to us out here, what makes you think she'll listen to us in there?"
4,49,Janet,I know one thing that might keep her attention.
4,49,Judge,Idiots.
4,49,Judge,"Oh, nuts!"
4,49,Judge,How did I fall for that?
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Please have a seat, Your Honor."
4,49,Judge,"I already told you, I am not interested."
4,49,Judge,Give me one good reason why I should hear you out.
4,49,Janet,Okay.
4,49,Janet,Here he is.
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Ma'am.
4,49,Judge,You made me an Olyphant?
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"I think you should hear them out, Judge."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Only seems fair.
4,49,Judge,"Yeah, you're probably right."
4,49,Judge,"Well played, Janet."
4,49,Judge,I don't mind taking in the view when the scenery is so pretty.
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Aw!
4,49,Judge,"Oh, I should call Shawn for this."
4,49,Shawn,"Aw, man!"
4,49,Shawn,I had just gotten all the puppies to climb into the cannon.
4,49,Judge,All right.
4,49,Judge,Floor is yours.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"So, the problem with the afterlife is not only that it's that it's cruel, but that it's final."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"You get one shot on Earth, and regardless of the context of your life, you're placed somewhere, usually the Bad Place, forever, with no chance for redemption."
4,49,Michael,"My neighborhood was built to torture humans, but it made them better."
4,49,Michael,"We want to create a system that works that way intentionally, a system designed to give people a fighting chance."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,In time --
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Huh?
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Interesting.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Why don't you walk us through it?
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we're gonna, man."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just chill.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Your time on Earth won't be a a test that you either pass or fail, but instead a class you take, and the test will come in the afterlife."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,The first part stays the same.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"You live your life, screw up a bunch of stuff, like, a lot of stuff, like, to the point where people are like, ""This is messed up, even for Florida."""
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"But you can't hear them, because you fell into the swamp trying to spray-paint a Taco Bell logo on a snapping turtle."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, we rest our case, Your Honor."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,No!
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"No, no, no."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, we --"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"No, we don't."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,We barely started.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, so, when you die, you still have a a points total, but in the new system, that number will serve as a sort of baseline to determine how hard or easy your test is."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"Sorry, I'm just trying to play catch-up here."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"Who's designing these tests, exactly?"
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,A Good Place architect and a Bad Place architect will work together to design a scenario to make you confront your moral shortcomings.
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness and my completely inability to carry off a mod look."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's not --
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I know I have other faults, but that is a big one."
4,49,Michael,The test could be anything.
4,49,Michael,"Maybe you show up and you're told you're in the Good Place, but you know that it's a a mistake."
4,49,Michael,Maybe the test looks just like your regular life or a twisted version of your life.
4,49,Michael,You're presented with these challenges.
4,49,Michael,"You do well or badly, but at the end, you're given a sort of evaluation."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, and the architects explain what you did badly, what you did well, and then you get rebooted, and do it again, and again and again until you ace it."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,In the new --
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"Oh, hang on."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"It seems to me, if y'all get rebooted, your memories'll be wiped out."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,How are you ever gonna learn anything if you're always having to start from scratch?
4,49,Judge,Mmm-hmm.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good point, Timothy Olyphant."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Tim's fine.
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, 'kay, great."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In the new system, you will retain a vague memory of what you learned in the evaluation sessions."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That information, what you did well or badly, stays with you, like like a little voice in your head, helping you become a better version of yourself."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"Okay, that helps."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,Thank you.
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"So, our guess is that with enough chances, people will eventually make enough good choices to qualify for the Good Place, and maybe some never will, but that's okay, because everyone gets a fair shot."
4,49,Shawn,Hold the phone.
4,49,Shawn,What are my demons doing this whole time?
4,49,Shawn,I have millions of lava monsters down there who'll be out of a job.
4,49,Shawn,"I ask you, into whose throats are they supposed to pour lava?"
4,49,Michael,"Well, bad news is, no more throat lava or penis flattenings."
4,49,Shawn,"Then, what are we doing to their penises?"
4,49,Michael,"Well, largely ignoring them."
4,49,Shawn,You guys are hearing this.
4,49,Shawn,"I'm not crazy, right?"
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"No, I mean, it's a fair question."
4,49,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Whose side are you on, man?"
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,"I don't have a dog in this fight, little lady."
4,49,Timothy Olyphant,I'm just looking for clarity.
4,49,Michael,"Shawn, you'll all still have jobs."
4,49,Michael,Bad Place architects help design the tests.
4,49,Michael,"Rank and file demons, they'll play roles, just like they did in my original neighborhood."
4,49,Michael,And remember how much fun you had playing the Judge?
4,49,Judge,"I don't know, guys."
4,49,Judge,You think this'll work?
4,49,Jason Mendoza,It sort of already has.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Chidi just had 800 versions of himself stuffed into his soul at the same time.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, he's a new man."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,He's way cooler now.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Uh, I liked the old version, too, but not as much."
4,49,Janet,"It's not just Chidi, Your Honor."
4,49,Janet,"When I started in Michael's first neighborhood, I was nothing more than a PalmPilot in a cool vest, but look at me now."
4,49,Janet,I can hold four humans in my void and conjure Timothy Olyphant in the blink of an eye.
4,49,Janet,Getting rebooted over and over made me a better not-a-person than I've ever been.
4,49,Janet,Humans should get the same opportunity.
4,49,Judge,Well?
4,49,Shawn,Hmm.
4,49,Shawn,Pass!
4,49,Judge,"Well, guys, I really thought you had it."
4,49,Judge,"It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie."
4,49,Judge,Oh.
4,49,Judge,"Gonna erase the Earth, erase the Earth."
4,49,Janet,"I hid the clicker as far away as possible, but we are seconds away."
4,49,Janet,"I'm so sorry, guys."
4,49,Michael,Where did Shawn go?
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, don't bother."
4,49,Tahani Al-Jamil,He's just toying with us.
4,49,Michael,I know.
4,49,Michael,That's what gives me hope.
4,49,Shawn,Had to do it one last time before all this goes away for good.
4,49,Shawn,"So, what are you offering me now?"
4,49,Michael,Nothing.
4,49,Michael,It's over.
4,49,Michael,That was our last idea.
4,49,Shawn,Good.
4,49,Shawn,"Soon, all your precious humans will be gone."
4,49,Michael,Yeah.
4,49,Michael,It's too bad.
4,49,Michael,"Well, congrats, bud."
4,49,Michael,You won.
4,49,Michael,See you in a billion years.
4,49,Shawn,"When the humans evolve again, I'll be right back at your throat, you traitor!"
4,49,Michael,"I mean, yeah, I know."
4,49,Michael,"That's why I said, ""See you in a billion years."""
4,49,Shawn,Wait.
4,49,Shawn,I'm gonna do the evil speech now.
4,49,Michael,If you want.
4,49,Shawn,"""Since the dawn of time, good and evil have waged a furious battle, stemming from"""
4,49,Shawn,This feels stupid if you're not gonna fight back.
4,49,Shawn,How do you not have another plan?
4,49,Shawn,You've always had another plan.
4,49,Michael,"What's wrong, Shawn?"
4,49,Shawn,"Okay, fine."
4,49,Shawn,You're gonna make me admit it.
4,49,Shawn,Fighting you is the most fun I've ever had.
4,49,Shawn,"I mean, you know."
4,49,Shawn,"You corkscrew your first eyeball, and you're like, ""Man, I can't believe they're paying me to do this!"""
4,49,Shawn,"But by the trillionth, it's like, ""I should have just been a teacher."""
4,49,Shawn,"And then you go and get the warm fuzzies about your little humans, and something something changed."
4,49,Shawn,I was having fun again.
4,49,Shawn,I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.
4,49,Michael,"I know, buddy."
4,49,Michael,"It's hard when things end, but one way or the other, this is over."
4,49,Michael,"The only question is, what's next?"
4,49,Michael,I heard your speech at Demon-Con.
4,49,Michael,You know this system stinks.
4,49,Michael,You wouldn't have let me try the original experiment if things were working.
4,49,Michael,Let's try a new way.
4,49,Michael,Together.
4,49,Judge,"Okay, finally."
4,49,Judge,"For the last time, I, the Judge of the afterlife --"
4,49,Michael,"Hang on, Your Honor."
4,49,Judge,Argh!
4,49,Judge,Are you kidding me?
4,49,Judge,Can't a gal just end all of humanity one time without everyone getting all up on her junk?
4,49,Judge,"What is it, man?"
4,49,Michael,Shawn has agreed to our proposal.
4,49,Judge,"Wait, seriously?"
4,49,Shawn,"In principle, yes."
4,49,Shawn,Still some kinks to work in.
4,49,Michael,Out.
4,49,Shawn,Out.
4,49,Shawn,"Sorry, old habits."
4,49,Shawn,But I think we can find a way to make it work.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,"Guys, watch this!"
4,49,Judge,Jason!
4,49,All,"No, no, no."
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Sorry.
4,49,Jason Mendoza,Jeez!
4,49,Judge,"Okay, well assuming we are redesigning the entire afterlife according to this plan, what do we do first?"
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, don't look at me."
4,49,Chidi Anagonye,I'm I'm just the idea guy.
4,50,Megan,Anything?
4,50,Steve,Nope.
4,50,Steve,Nobody knows squat.
4,50,Megan,What the here is going on?
4,50,Megan,"We haven't had any new humans to torture in, like, a week."
4,50,Megan,I miss it.
4,50,Steve,I know.
4,50,Steve,"I got so desperate this morning, I tried flattening an eggplant."
4,50,Steve,It's just not the same.
4,50,Bad Janet,Hey!
4,50,Bad Janet,Skin tags.
4,50,Bad Janet,Special meeting.
4,50,Steve,About what?
4,50,Bad Janet,I don't know.
4,50,Bad Janet,Probably your dad's stinky sack.
4,50,Steve,I hope it's not more sexual harassment training.
4,50,Steve,We just did that.
4,50,Steve,And I'm already so good at it.
4,50,Steve,Whoa!
4,50,Steve,All right!
4,50,Steve,We got 'em.
4,50,Michael,Yeah.
4,50,Michael,"Uh, that's not exactly what's happening here."
4,50,Michael,"The Bad Place is going to be changing, and I'm well, I'm kind of your boss now."
4,50,Megan,"He's joking, right?"
4,50,Shawn,I'm afraid he's not.
4,50,Shawn,Things are changing.
4,50,Shawn,Michael and I are actually going to be wor wor wor working together.
4,50,Shawn,Ugh!
4,50,Shawn,"Oh, I hated that."
4,50,Shawn,"I hated saying it, hated how it felt, hated all of it."
4,50,Shawn,Ew!
4,50,Michael,You all have been hand-selected to be the very first Bad Place architects who will learn the new system.
4,50,Megan,Why do we need a new system?
4,50,Megan,Torture works.
4,50,Megan,It's the way it's always been done.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"With all due respect, ""it's the way it's always been done,"" is an excuse that's been used for hundreds of years to justify racism, misogyny --"
4,50,Steve,Exactly!
4,50,Steve,See?
4,50,Steve,This chick gets it.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"So, these computers have access to every file for every human currently in the Bad Place."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,And the three of us have a very important job.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,To find out which former US presidents were secretly gay.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, fine."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Bi.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Sure, but also, while Michael is trying to get the architects trained, we're supposed to find the first 1,000 humans to take the test."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"People who'll just sail right through it, so we can build confidence in the system."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"So, what are the criteria?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Should it be people with the highest point totals, or overcame the greatest hardship?"
4,50,Jason Mendoza,I think we just start with the gimmes.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"The very best people who ever lived, so Evel Knievel, Kool-Aid Man, Mini-Me, DJ Jazzy Jeff a genie so we could wish for infinity people"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Jason --
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Sure, throw me in there, too."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Also Fat Bastard, The World's Most Interesting Man, Pikachu, Karate Kid, Wendy from Wendy's, Grumpy Cat, and the GPS lady that tells you where to drive."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Feels like a good stopping point.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Let's call it a day.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Come back fresh tomorrow.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Great job, everyone!"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,What --
4,50,Michael,Okay.
4,50,Michael,"Janet's passing out the file on Tahani Al-Jamil, who volunteered to be today's test subject."
4,50,Michael,"So, take a look and then we'll get going."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,They don't seem very enthused.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,This may be a tougher challenge than I thought.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Like when I tried to teach Taylor Swift how to dance.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,The longest four years of my life.
4,50,Michael,"We're uprooting the entire Bad Place system, and these architects are set in their ways."
4,50,Michael,It's gonna take a lot of work.
4,50,Michael,"But the work is the fun part, guys."
4,50,Michael,"So, no matter how long it takes, we'll see it through and usher in a better, brighter future."
4,50,Phil,Screw this.
4,50,Phil,I'm not working for a traitor.
4,50,Phil,Phil out.
4,50,Phil,"That's my name, Phil."
4,50,Michael,"Oh, Phil."
4,50,Michael,Hey.
4,50,Michael,"Come on, buddy."
4,50,Michael,I personally chose you based on your innovative work in the Performative Wokeness department.
4,50,Phil,Wow.
4,50,Phil,Way to mansplain my own department to me.
4,50,Phil,And I'm triggered.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, man!"
4,50,Jason Mendoza,What a legend!
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who you reading about?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Me.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,I ruled on Earth.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"I siphoned so much gas, Eleanor."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Even if the car was moving, or on fire, or a boat, I still always got that gas."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I never thought about the fact that we could look up our own files.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,I printed out all of ours.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I love you, okay?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"The words are nice, but the tone is scary."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We're in love, and everything's great, and if we wanna keep it that way, you have to promise to never, ever, ever read my file."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, if you don't want me to, then of course I won't, but nothing in there could ever change how I feel about you."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Eh.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You say that now, but you don't know what I did on Halloween 2013."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,What did you do on Halloween 2013?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I don't remember, but it must've been bad."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because the next morning, I woke up in a large Rubbermaid container in some family's basement, and I'd barfed all over their old photo albums."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, see?"
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"That's the look we're trying to avoid here, bud."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I don't need to read your file.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I know you.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"And I love you, and I can't wait to spend eternity with you."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, obviously, we have a lot of work to do here, and then we both have to pass the test."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"But, eventually, we're gonna be together forever."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,You have to read my file right now.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I'm confused.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Is this a game?
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Is it a sex game, somehow?"
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can't risk it.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What if we spend half of eternity together, and then, you find out something that does change the way you feel about me and then you resent me for wasting half your eternity?"
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It's better we just rip the Band-Aid off and you read about all the bad stuff now, when we're hot and heavy."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I'll read your file.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Can I finish reading about Oskar Schindler first?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's who I gotta follow?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,The list guy?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You and I are so screwed, dude."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"After as many attempts as it takes, if your human passes the test and proves that they deserve to go to the Good Place, you'll hear this sound."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Good Place, here I come."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,This new system is great!
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Who do we have to thank for effortlessly implementing it?
4,50,Michael,"Whoever it is, I think we can all agree it was a home run."
4,50,Michael,It was me.
4,50,Michael,Okay.
4,50,Michael,"Bye, everyone."
4,50,Steve,Sweet Hitler's hairpiece!
4,50,Steve,Is this movie finally over?
4,50,Michael,It's basically over.
4,50,Michael,Just one little --
4,50,Janet,"It's simply the test, better than other tests."
4,50,Janet,I think we just
4,50,Michael,Okay.
4,50,Michael,"So, thoughts?"
4,50,Megan,Yeah.
4,50,Megan,This all sounds so lame.
4,50,Michael,"No, it's the current system that's lame."
4,50,Michael,It's so basic.
4,50,Michael,"You get a human's file, and let's be honest, you never even read it."
4,50,Michael,"You just skip to the ""fears and phobias"" section and use that to torture them."
4,50,Michael,Fear of snakes?
4,50,Michael,Throw 'em in a snake pit.
4,50,Michael,"Worried something's gonna happen to your normal, cylindrical penis?"
4,50,Michael,Flatten it.
4,50,Michael,This new way allows you to test their specific psychological flaws and weaknesses.
4,50,Janet,"And trust us, they have plenty."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hey!
4,50,Janet,Sorry.
4,50,Janet,I'm in selling mode.
4,50,Michael,"Guys, this is your chance to be part of a bold, new future."
4,50,Michael,Are you telling me there's not one single demon who wants to design the very first sample test of this new system?
4,50,Vicky,"Oh, there is."
4,50,Vicky,And she's a stone-cold fox.
4,50,Michael,"Vicky, what are you doing here?"
4,50,Vicky,Relax.
4,50,Vicky,I heard about the new system.
4,50,Vicky,"I love it, and I wanna be a part of it."
4,50,Michael,"Forgive me if I'm a little skeptical, given that you did once try to sabotage my entire neighborhood."
4,50,Vicky,Look.
4,50,Vicky,"After you blew me into goo, I had a lot of time to think while my goo was reforming."
4,50,Vicky,"If things are gonna change, then I have to change along with them."
4,50,Vicky,"And sure, change can be scary, but I'm an artist, which means, it's my job to be scared."
4,50,Michael,"All right, fine, take a seat."
4,50,Michael,Janet'll give you Tahani's file.
4,50,Vicky,"Oh, no."
4,50,Vicky,I don't I don't need her file.
4,50,Vicky,I know Tahani very well.
4,50,Vicky,"Self-obsessed, family issues, way too into being tall."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Typical Vicky, throwing shade."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm casting it."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Because I'm closer to the sun.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm tall.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I knew it.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,You hate me now.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,What did it?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,That time I was subpoenaed by the Make-A-Wish Foundation?
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,No.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, I know what it was."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"In my defense, I didn't realize he was my boyfriend's twin until halfway into hooking up with him, and at that point, you know, it's a sunk cost."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I don't hate you at all.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, you were dealt a pretty tough hand."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"You essentially had to raise yourself, but you were still more confident and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, seeing your whole life all laid out like this, it's it's remarkable."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, so you still love me."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're still horny for me, blah, blah, blah"
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Then, what's wrong?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I'm not good enough for you!
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I mean look at my file.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"It is one-tenth as long as yours, because I did nothing with my life."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yeah, we're very different, but we already knew that."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why are you freaking out?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're cool, confident Chidi now, remember?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I am confident about my feelings for you.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"I am also confident that I am a damn drip, and you deserve to be with someone who's not."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Like Nicolas, that fireman that you dated back in 2009?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"He rescued people from burning buildings, and he was so hot!"
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Nicolas the fireman mmm."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Nicolas.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I can't argue with you on that one, but I love you."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's no one else I wanna be with.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At least, not forever."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, if Frida Kahlo wants to make out with me in heaven then you and I are gonna have a conversation, but if you read my file and you're good, then we're good."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Unless there's something in your file that would freak me out, like you kept out a library book past the due date."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,What --
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I moved!
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,And it got buried in the bottom of a box.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I put the library in my will to make up for it.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I'm kidding."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm kidding.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Relax.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's get back to work.
4,50,Michael,"Now, when I press this lever, Tahani will enter the scenario that Megan has designed that will test her ethical decision-making."
4,50,Michael,"Obviously, in the real test, the humans won't know they're being tested, but this should be a good practice run."
4,50,Michael,Everyone ready?
4,50,Waiter,Hors d'oeuvre?
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Why, yes."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
4,50,Michael,"Okay, so, couple of things."
4,50,Michael,"We're not using chainsaw bears anymore, remember?"
4,50,Megan,Right.
4,50,Megan,Okay.
4,50,Megan,Yeah.
4,50,Megan,What else?
4,50,Michael,It was mainly that one thing.
4,50,Michael,Why don't you try again?
4,50,Michael,And remember that the challenges your test subject faces should be smaller and and more relatable.
4,50,Michael,Okay.
4,50,Waiter,Hors d'oeuvre?
4,50,Waiter,It's salmon crudites.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Is it farm-raised salmon?
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Cause I prefer to support sustainable fishing.
4,50,Megan,"You said ""smaller and more relatable""."
4,50,Megan,"The bear is smaller, humans hate Mondays and love bacon."
4,50,Megan,What do you want from me?
4,50,Vicky,"Michael, can I try?"
4,50,Vicky,I can show them what you're trying to do.
4,50,Michael,"Fine, Vicky, go ahead."
4,50,Vicky,"Now, first, I need to get into Tahani's headspace."
4,50,Vicky,"Hello, love."
4,50,Vicky,"Pish-posh, tuna and pickles."
4,50,Vicky,I once played billiards with Questlove and Olivia Munn.
4,50,Vicky,"Yeah, there she is."
4,50,Vicky,"Okay, just give me a second."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ooh.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just finished reading up about James Buchanan.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Definitely at least a little bi.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm gonna put him in the maybe pile.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I want nachos.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is there a snack bar here?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"What's going on, dawg?"
4,50,Jason Mendoza,I know you're upset.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,You have a tell.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I do?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"You told Eleanor before that you were upset, and I think you still are."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Looking at Eleanor's life made me realize how different we are.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"If the system works, and we both pass our tests, I don't see any version of eternity where she doesn't get bored of me."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, my fake heaven was a 600 square-foot apartment that was essentially a bookcase and a toilet and I loved it."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,So what?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,It's cool that you guys are so different.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Sometimes, two people who have nothing in common get together, and it rules."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Opposites attract.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, you need that to be true because you're dating Janet."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Ultimate opposites.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"So, what, are you saying Janet might get bored of me?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"No, that's not I'm sorry."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I didn't mean
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Man oh, no."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"No, Jason."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Come back, I"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,I wish I were back in my toilet library.
4,50,Vicky,"And places, and action."
4,50,Anais,Can you believe we're still having this dinner for Kamilah?
4,50,Anais,So embarrassing.
4,50,Georges,"She doesn't know this yet, but I heard that the reviews for her new album are going to be dreadful."
4,50,Georges,The rumor is that the label is going to drop her.
4,50,Anais,"I heard she may have to fly home coach and ""check a bag"", whatever that means."
4,50,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Thank you, everyone, for coming to celebrate our daughter Kamilah."
4,50,Manisha Al-Jamil,I know you're all very busy these days.
4,50,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Just look at our other daughter, Tahani."
4,50,Manisha Al-Jamil,She had to come straight from the gym.
4,50,Waqas Al-Jamil,"Would anyone like to say a few words of praise about Kamilah's latest album, or any other aspect of Kamilah?"
4,50,Waqas Al-Jamil,There are so many to celebrate.
4,50,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Perhaps Tahani should speak.
4,50,Kamilah Al-Jamil,She's had her share of failures recently.
4,50,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Celebrating me could be therapeutic.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Certainly.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can say something but I have no idea what.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Goodness, this is hard."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well done, Vicky."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,That was quite good for the system.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"For me, it was rather traumatic."
4,50,Megan,Okay.
4,50,Megan,"It's like her parents were the chainsaw bear, but instead of chopping off her head, they chopped off her self-esteem?"
4,50,Vicky,Yes!
4,50,Vicky,"Megan, good."
4,50,Vicky,"Take what you know about them, and then force them into moments of personal difficulty."
4,50,Vicky,"Think of it as, flattening the penises of their heart."
4,50,Steve,Oh!
4,50,Steve,Now it makes sense.
4,50,Vicky,Why don't you go deeper into her file and look for other ways to challenge her?
4,50,Michael,No.
4,50,Michael,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
4,50,Michael,Slow down.
4,50,Michael,"Slow down, here."
4,50,Michael,Vicky's example was fine.
4,50,Michael,There was some good stuff there.
4,50,Michael,"But overall uh, C-plus."
4,50,Michael,"It was a C-plus, I'd say."
4,50,Michael,There's some problems with it.
4,50,Michael,"Some technical issues that only I can see and everything, so, basically, it actually kinda stunk."
4,50,Michael,"So, I think it's just best if you leave, Vicky."
4,50,Michael,This is not working.
4,50,Michael,You're bad at this.
4,50,Michael,C-plus.
4,50,Michael,"Okay, goodbye."
4,50,Vicky,Wow.
4,50,Vicky,"Same old Michael, just can't share the spotlight."
4,50,Vicky,"Well, goodbye, everyone."
4,50,Vicky,That's a wrap on Vicky.
4,50,Janet,"Michael, why did you fire Vicky?"
4,50,Michael,"Look, I know she did well on the first test."
4,50,Michael,But it's beginner's luck.
4,50,Michael,There's an X factor here.
4,50,Michael,"Uh, a secret sauce that only I truly know how to pour over the the juicy steak of this process."
4,50,Janet,"I've never said this before, but what?"
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Not only is Vicky good at test design, but she's good at teaching the others."
4,50,Michael,"Well, that's the problem."
4,50,Michael,She's moving too fast.
4,50,Michael,We have to learn how to walk before we can run.
4,50,Janet,"So first you thought it would take forever, and now it's moving too fast."
4,50,Michael,"First of all, you know, uh, shut up."
4,50,Michael,"And second of all, just shut up."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's obvious what's going on here.
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,You don't want your nemesis to be the one to solve your problem.
4,50,Janet,I know that feeling.
4,50,Janet,"Once on Earth, I didn't know something, and I had to ask Alexa."
4,50,Janet,I felt dirty.
4,50,Michael,"No, that's not it."
4,50,Michael,"I'm upset, because for hundreds of years, I've had a job."
4,50,Michael,"First, it was finding a better way to torture humans, then helping them, then proving the system was broken, then teaching the demons."
4,50,Michael,"I had to roll a rock up a hill, over and over."
4,50,Michael,"And then it kept rolling down, so I had to do it again."
4,50,Michael,"And then Vicky comes along with this like, rock-lifter thing, and just lifts it to the top of the hill."
4,50,Michael,Pushing the rock up the hill gave me a purpose.
4,50,Michael,Who am I if the rock's gone?
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Ironically, that's exactly what Vin Diesel asked me when Dwayne Johnson refused to appear in Fast & Furious 9."
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Not helpful?
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,Copy that.
4,50,Janet,"Honestly, Michael, I don't know what's to become of you, or any of us."
4,50,Janet,But getting Vicky back is the best chance to make your plan work now.
4,50,Janet,"So focus on that, and deal with the future in the future."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey um I'm sorry I said that before, man."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"No, you were right."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Janet and I are different.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Maybe it can't last.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Maybe we're like the Montagues and Capulets.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,How do you know that?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"I read some books, man!"
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Jeez.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"All right, listen."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Maybe on paper, you and Janet don't make total sense, but who cares?"
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,The relationship you have built together is wonderful.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"She knows you and loves you, and that's all that matters."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Do you really believe that?
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Of course I do.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Sucker!
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Sorry?
4,50,Jason Mendoza,I got you so bad.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Dude, pretend what you just said was what you said to you instead of to me."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"And you have to listen to yourself, because it was already in your own head, and then came out."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"But just put it back in your head, and realize that it was you talking about you and Eleanor."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Against all odds, I know what you mean, and I I gotta give it up."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,That was that was good.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, it was."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Chess-mate.
4,50,Michael,Hey!
4,50,Michael,There she is.
4,50,Michael,Where are you off to?
4,50,Vicky,I have an ice-cold yoga class.
4,50,Vicky,It's amazing.
4,50,Vicky,You pull so many muscles.
4,50,Michael,Yeah.
4,50,Vicky,What do you want?
4,50,Michael,I'm sorry that I kicked you out.
4,50,Michael,It wasn't about you.
4,50,Michael,It was just my own insecurities getting in the way.
4,50,Michael,Will you please come back?
4,50,Vicky,No.
4,50,Vicky,I'm not gonna let myself be degraded by you again.
4,50,Vicky,"I am a strong, independent acid snake in the skinsuit of a strong, independent woman."
4,50,Michael,"Listen, listen, listen."
4,50,Michael,Uh you were the best part of my original neighborhood.
4,50,Michael,"I took you for granted, and that was wrong."
4,50,Michael,"But now, I want to give you the role of a lifetime."
4,50,Michael,You're going to run the whole project.
4,50,Michael,"I'll give you all my plans and my notes, but then I'll I'll step back and and you'll take over."
4,50,Michael,Full creative control like a director.
4,50,Michael,What do you say?
4,50,Vicky,"Well, um it sounds great."
4,50,Vicky,But it won't work.
4,50,Vicky,"Everyone here hates you so much, if you just put me in control, they'll think I'm your puppet."
4,50,Vicky,I can't have any of your dingleberry stank on me.
4,50,Michael,I know.
4,50,Michael,That's why I'm not giving it to you.
4,50,Michael,You're going to take it.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Hey.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"So, uh, I was being stupid, and Jason gave me some really good advice."
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Classic us.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Look, who we were on Earth is a tiny part of who we are, and an even smaller part of who we are together."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"So, I'm sorry for freaking out."
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"But also, someday, when we get to the Good Place, I'm gonna learn to play the guitar so you don't get bored of me."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,I actually prefer drummers.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Read my file.
4,50,Michael,Sorry for the delay.
4,50,Michael,"Now, for this next phase of the training --"
4,50,Vicky,Stop right there.
4,50,Michael,Vicky?
4,50,Michael,I thought I got rid of you.
4,50,Michael,And now you're coming through the door unexpectedly?
4,50,Vicky,That's right.
4,50,Vicky,I'm launching a coup.
4,50,Vicky,"My, my, my, we've got some history, don't we?"
4,50,Vicky,"But I'm still standing, Mikey-boy."
4,50,Vicky,"And right now, I'm taking over."
4,50,Michael,"Explain what you mean, for me and everyone else."
4,50,Vicky,"Oh, this is my training now."
4,50,Vicky,You're done.
4,50,Vicky,"And all of these demons are behind me, right, guys?"
4,50,Michael,"All right, Vicky."
4,50,Michael,You win this time.
4,50,Michael,"Tahani, Janet, let's go."
4,50,Janet,Huh.
4,50,Vicky,"Well, no, but wait wait, we're still fighting."
4,50,Vicky,"And it's so heated that, um, it might just erupt into the dance battle from West Side Story?"
4,50,Michael,"No, I'm too upset about the coup thing."
4,50,Michael,"Hurry up, hurry up."
4,50,Michael,Before she starts singing.
4,50,Vicky,Welcome!
4,50,Vicky,"Welcome, everyone!"
4,50,Vicky,Come on in.
4,50,Vicky,"Good Place architects to my left, Bad Place architects to my right."
4,50,Vicky,Get your files and orientation packets.
4,50,Vicky,Classes begin in 30 minutes.
4,50,Vicky,"Oh, also, my Movement for Lava Monsters class is now full."
4,50,Todd Hemple,"Aw, man!"
4,50,Janet,"You got the rock up the hill, and it looks like it's gonna stay there."
4,50,Janet,Now we just have to find your next rock.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, the first bunch of neighborhoods is up and running."
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,What now?
4,50,Tahani Al-Jamil,That's the sound of when someone gets into the Good Place.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Who was it?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,Prince?
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's gotta be Prince.
4,50,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Honestly, if it wasn't Prince, this whole thing is screwed up and we gotta start over."
4,50,Michael,No.
4,50,Michael,It's you guys.
4,50,Jason Mendoza,For real?
4,50,Michael,The Judge agreed that the four of you don't need to take the test.
4,50,Michael,Turns out that saving every soul in the universe is worth a few points.
4,50,Michael,You're in.
4,50,Michael,"No, I know."
4,50,Michael,I know.
4,50,Michael,It's real this time.
4,50,Michael,I promise.
4,50,Michael,Get in.
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,"Are you coming, too?"
4,50,Michael,Yeah.
4,50,Michael,I figured I would.
4,50,Michael,Recently unemployed.
4,50,Michael,Might as well do some traveling.
4,50,Michael,Shall we?
4,50,Chidi Anagonye,Whoa!
4,50,Jason Mendoza,Foles!
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,We're finally headed to the Good Place.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It's the ""me"" of places."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,I got in.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,I can say stuff like that again.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"Are you sure we're going the right way, Janet?"
4,51,Janet,"Well, I've never been to the Good Place before."
4,51,Janet,"But, yes, I am sure."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,How?
4,51,Janet,Because it feels like I'm on my way home.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Flying puppy!
4,51,Michael,Flying puppies?
4,51,Michael,"Dang it, Michael."
4,51,Michael,Why didn't you think of that for your neighborhood?
4,51,Michael,These guys are good.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"It feels just like Dorothy when she lands in Oz, excited, incredulous, much taller than everyone else around me."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's everyone wanna do first?
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Racing go-karts with monkeys.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Sure.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,It's my lifelong dream.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Monkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"They're funny enough to give the finger, but not smart enough to win."
4,51,Janet,Does that mean me?
4,51,Michael,You're a Good Janet.
4,51,Michael,We're in the Good Place.
4,51,Michael,I don't know who else it would mean.
4,51,Janet,Okay.
4,51,Janet,No pressure.
4,51,Janet,I was born to do this.
4,51,Janet,Not born.
4,51,Janet,Okay.
4,51,Janet,"So, I now know all the information about the Good Place."
4,51,Janet,"In a nutshell, it slaps."
4,51,Janet,"First thing to tell you, humans can't see the Good Place all at once or their brains will be scrambled."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Cool.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Maybe I'll finally get some of those squigglies on my brain.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Doctors said my brain's as smooth as an egg.
4,51,Janet,"You all need to wait out here for a bit, so you can adjust."
4,51,Janet,"When you're ready, you will be honored with a welcome gala, magically planned by the Good Place, based on your personalities."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Like the targeted Instagram ad of parties.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, I bought the coolest sunglasses from one of those ads."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Look.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Whoa!
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's like I'm inside the Internet.
4,51,Michael,Okay.
4,51,Michael,Could we just keep moving?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,You look a little pale.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Did you get sick from the hot air balloon?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I bet if you throw up it'll just be butterflies or something.
4,51,Michael,I'm fine.
4,51,Michael,"I just, um I don't belong here."
4,51,Michael,There's no telling what will happen to a demon who steps foot in this place.
4,51,Michael,"Promise me, if I'm vaporized, you guys just keep having fun."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, my goodness, that chime is so soothing."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Feels like my brain is being massaged
4,51,Chidi Anagonye, by a baby deer.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil, by a baby deer.
4,51,Michael,"Oh, boy."
4,51,Michael,"What if that's some sort of demon alarm, to alert the cops that I'm here?"
4,51,Jason Mendoza,You want me to hold your weed?
4,51,Michael,I don't have weed.
4,51,Michael,Oh wait a minute.
4,51,Michael,"Oh, yeah, okay, now, I do."
4,51,Michael,Take this.
4,51,Janet,They're ready for you to move inside.
4,51,Janet,The Good Place Committee is waiting for us.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, man, look at this place."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Karlie Kloss did like me.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,I knew it.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"So, about this party"
4,51,Janet,Yeah.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Is everyone in the Good Place invited?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Like, is Aristotle going to be there?"
4,51,Janet,"Sorry, Chidi, Aristotle's in the Bad Place."
4,51,Janet,He defended slavery.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Socrates?
4,51,Janet,No.
4,51,Janet,Too annoying.
4,51,Janet,Very loud chewer.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Plato?
4,51,Janet,Slavery again.
4,51,Janet,"Ooh, you know who is here?"
4,51,Janet,Hypatia of Alexandria.
4,51,Janet,Do you know her?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Hypatia?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Of Alexandria?
4,51,Janet,That's right.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yeah, I know her."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Hypatia.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna ask her so many questions pertaining to grand ideas about the universe.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Like ""Why?"""
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, oh, and also ""How?"""
4,51,Janet,Ooh!
4,51,Meg,"Welcome to the Good Place, everyone."
4,51,Drew,"Michael, so happy you made it."
4,51,Drew,You look radiant.
4,51,Drew,You have the calming yet authoritative presence of a bomb-sniffing dog.
4,51,Michael,I'd just like to say thank you so much for letting me be here with my friends.
4,51,Michael,"I know it's unorthodox for someone like myself to visit the Good Place, but it's just so wonderful."
4,51,Michael,"And I don't have any weed on me, so no need for the cops."
4,51,Chuck,"Michael, Michael, you and your friends are heroes, and you're more than welcome here."
4,51,Chuck,"In fact, we have some very exciting news."
4,51,Andie,"While the rest of you get settled in, we wanna give Michael a swearing-in ceremony, so he can become an official Good Place architect."
4,51,Michael,"Oh, my goodness."
4,51,Chuck,"Michael, please, follow us."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Holy fork, that is a soothing chime."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,It really is the most incredible chime I've ever heard.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,And that is coming from someone whose godfather is the most famous clock in the world.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Is Big Ben somehow your godfather?
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Mmm-hmm.
4,51,Janet,That sound means it's party time.
4,51,Janet,"When you walk through, the event space will transform into a party perfectly tailored to your essences."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let's link arms and walk through together.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Weird.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Whoa!
4,51,Jason Mendoza,This is the Jacksonville SuperSuites hotel ballroom where I had my prom and also traffic court.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But this has to be my party, because that's the bedpan that Stone Cold Steve Austin used to beat up Vince McMahon in 1998."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,It was a classic moment.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Don't judge me.
4,51,Janet,"I'm so sorry, guys."
4,51,Janet,"The Good Place uses your life experiences to plan the perfect party, but it's only designed for one person at a time."
4,51,Janet,"When you walked in as a group, it became"
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,A mish-mash of all four of us.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's perfect.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"Um, no, it's not, Eleanor, because there's no go-kart track, and no monkeys."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"No offense, but you're being a real smooth-brain right now."
4,51,Janet,See those green doors?
4,51,Janet,"You can use them to visit any time or place, real or imagined."
4,51,Janet,"Just think about where you wanna go, and what you wanna do, and walk on through."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, one could walk amongst the dinosaurs, or witness the very first production of Hamlet at the Globe Theater."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,I'mma go Tokyo Drift with monkeys.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,See you in a thousand years.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Do you mind if I go find Hypatia?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"I, I, I promise it's strictly platonic."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Technically, Neoplatonic."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Whoops.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Forget I made that joke and come with me.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I'm so nervous to meet her.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,And I need someone cool there to change the subject if I say something dumb.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Gimme one sec.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, Tahani, this room is filled with some of the most interesting people that ever lived."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Chat them up, learn about their lives, then meet back here so that we can make fun of them."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Eleanor Shellstrop, I have been training for this day my entire life."
4,51,Michael,I'm so honored by this gesture.
4,51,Michael,This feels right.
4,51,Michael,This will be my new purpose.
4,51,Michael,Everything's falling into place.
4,51,Chuck,Great.
4,51,Chuck,Let's get to it.
4,51,Chuck,Just put on this ceremonial robe.
4,51,Drew,"Boy, do you have the shoulders for a robe."
4,51,Michael,Oh.
4,51,Daisuke,Just sign this scroll.
4,51,Michael,I've never signed my name before.
4,51,Michael,What signature type to choose?
4,51,Michael,"""Doctor Blob""."
4,51,Michael,"Or, no ""Athlete who doesn't really care about the kid."""
4,51,Michael,"Oh, wait, no ""Middle school girl with crush on Zac Efron."""
4,51,Michael,"That way, I can put a little heart over the ""I""."
4,51,Chuck,Perfect.
4,51,Chuck,And here is your official medal.
4,51,Michael,Now I know what Mary Lou Retton feels like.
4,51,Chuck,And great.
4,51,Chuck,"Now, you are officially in charge of the Good Place."
4,51,Michael,"I'm sorry, ""in charge""?"
4,51,Chuck,Yup.
4,51,Chuck,You're the boss now.
4,51,Chuck,"That was all legally binding, and we all quit, effective immediately."
4,51,Chuck,"That is irreversible, so it's all your problem now."
4,51,Chuck,Don't try to find us.
4,51,Chuck,"No take-backs, okay, bye-bye!"
4,51,Chuck,"Hurry up, move, move!"
4,51,Chuck,"Go, go, go!"
4,51,Michael,Hello?
4,51,Michael,Fellow Good Placemen?
4,51,Michael,Anyone in here?
4,51,Michael,"""Ideas for Improving the Good Place""."
4,51,Michael,Oh.
4,51,Michael,"""Music you can eat."""
4,51,Michael,"Oh, boy."
4,51,Michael,"""Giant mini-donuts, not just regular donuts."
4,51,Michael,"Dave will explain."""
4,51,Michael,Dave?
4,51,Michael,Can you explain?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, hi, are you are you Hypatia of Alexandria?"
4,51,Hypatia,Yep.
4,51,Hypatia,How's it hangin'?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,It's hangin' really well.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, I,.. I gotta say, I was expecting you to be, still, you know ancient Greek."
4,51,Hypatia,Oh!
4,51,Hypatia,"Well, no, we sort of stay current in this place."
4,51,Hypatia,What are the big things from Earth recently?
4,51,Hypatia,"Um, the Industrial Revolution, Manhattan Project, ""Gangnam Style"" I feel like I get it."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,It's really her!
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"I can just tell, somehow."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,It's Hypatia of Alexandria.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I know, babe."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, it is."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, sorry, I'm Eleanor."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,This exuberant weirdo is Chidi.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're new in town.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First question, how do you get the ""of"" in your name?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Is it just, like, where you hung out the most?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, am I Eleanor of the Cheesecake Factory Bar?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"No, also, is it ""Hy-pay-sha"" or ""Hy-pat-ia""?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Or in the ancient Greek, ""Who-put-tia""?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,There's a lot of fun debate about this.
4,51,Hypatia,You know what?
4,51,Hypatia,Just call me Patty.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, uh Patty, uh, um, I'm a huge fan."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"I, I had a poster of you on my wall in high school."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Actually, it was just a poster of Trinity from The Matrix."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,But that's how I imagined you would look.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Because you're so cool.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, is she the reason you got beat up so much?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,She's one of them!
4,51,Hypatia,Wanna get a milkshake?
4,51,Hypatia,I haven't been around newbies in a while.
4,51,Hypatia,You're a little intense.
4,51,Hypatia,Let's get a milkshake.
4,51,Hypatia,Yeah.
4,51,Hypatia,They make a milkshake here that's made out of actual stardust.
4,51,Hypatia,It's pretty good.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Getting milkshakes with Patty.
4,51,Hypatia,Yeah.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Um, but can I ask you a couple of questions first?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, you were a follower of Plotinus, who claimed that contemplation of our ultimate reality --"
4,51,Hypatia,"Wait, wait, wait, are you what's it called, a think-book-man?"
4,51,Hypatia,"No, um a think-read-book-man?"
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,A philosopher?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Yes.
4,51,Hypatia,"Sorry, it's been so long, my brain is foggy."
4,51,Hypatia,Listen carefully before I forget how to say this.
4,51,Hypatia,You gotta help us.
4,51,Hypatia,We are so screwed.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,We are?
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hello!
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm Tahani Al-Jamil.
4,51,Paltibaal,I'm Paltibaal.
4,51,Paltibaal,Welcome to paradise.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, what's your story?"
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Did you cure something?
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Or invent something?
4,51,Paltibaal,I helped the poor in ancient Phoenicia.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Excellent.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,I once had a SoulCycle instructor named Phoenicia.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,How did you die?
4,51,Paltibaal,I got a cut on my hand.
4,51,Paltibaal,"The year was 2491 BC, so that's pretty much all it took."
4,51,Paltibaal,"You got a cut, or you drank water that wasn't hot enough, and then, boom, dead."
4,51,Paltibaal,I would've killed for a vaccine.
4,51,Paltibaal,Any vaccine.
4,51,Paltibaal,It's crazy that you guys just don't like them now.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, what's your favorite part about living here?"
4,51,Paltibaal,"I mean, it's perfect."
4,51,Paltibaal,We're all having orgasms literally all the time.
4,51,Paltibaal,"I died a virgin, so that's real crazy."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Okay.
4,51,Janet,It's so nice to get to work alongside another Good Janet!
4,51,Good Place Janet,"Yes, it is."
4,51,Musa,"Janet, can I get a Coke?"
4,51,Musa,"No, a water."
4,51,Musa,"No, a lamp."
4,51,Musa,"No, a cat."
4,51,Janet,"So, people just ask you for things with no rhyme or reason?"
4,51,Good Place Janet,Yes!
4,51,Good Place Janet,And then I get them for them.
4,51,Good Place Janet,It's great.
4,51,Musa,Can I get a spaceship?
4,51,Musa,"No, one huge Junior Mint."
4,51,Musa,"No, a Coke."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,This milkshake is incredible.
4,51,Hypatia,Right?
4,51,Hypatia,This is how I spend most of my time.
4,51,Hypatia,"Sitting in beautiful places, drinking my milkshake, slowly peeing into my pants, which instantly evaporates and leaves no trace."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Sounds fun.
4,51,Hypatia,Mmm.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,But didn't you want to tell us how we're all screwed?
4,51,Hypatia,Ah!
4,51,Hypatia,Damn it.
4,51,Hypatia,This is the exact problem.
4,51,Hypatia,"On paper, this is paradise."
4,51,Hypatia,All of your desires and needs are met.
4,51,Hypatia,But it's infinite.
4,51,Hypatia,"And when perfection goes on forever, you become this glassy-eyed, mush person."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"But no, because no."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Because Patty, no!"
4,51,Hypatia,"Yes, I'm telling you."
4,51,Hypatia,"I used to be cool, man."
4,51,Hypatia,I studied so much things!
4,51,Hypatia,"Art and music, and, uh the one with the number piles?"
4,51,Hypatia,"Where I'd be like, ""Two!"""
4,51,Hypatia,"And you'd be like, ""Six!"""
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Math?
4,51,Hypatia,Yes.
4,51,Hypatia,"And then I came here, where time stretched out forever, and every second of my existence was amazing, but my brain became this big dumb blob."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, we finally make it into the Good Place, and now we're just going to become zombies?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why haven't you told anyone about this?
4,51,Hypatia,About what?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Dude.
4,51,Hypatia,Damn it!
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We have to find the others, right now."
4,51,Hypatia,"Look, there's math on my shirt."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
4,51,Hypatia,"Is it an ""S"" or a math?"
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Have you seen Eleanor and Chidi?
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,There's something very wrong with this party.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,And it's not just that the caviar is being served on top of Jell-O shots.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We are the first new people here in 500 years, and no one seems to care."
4,51,Janet,"I know, even the Good Janets are kinda weird."
4,51,Janet,"They're like, ""Hi, there!"""
4,51,Janet,"When I do it, it's cool, but when they do it, it's lame."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guys."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Having fun?
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, little update."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, the Good Place is a disaster."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Everyone here is a happiness zombie, and no one is doing anything about it, because by the time they realize it's happening, everyone is too far gone to care."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, dear!"
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, hello, I'm Tahani."
4,51,Hypatia,"Hi, I'm Milkshake."
4,51,Hypatia,Do you want a milkshake?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, okay."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,We need to tell someone before we're too zonked out to remember why we're here.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,We need to find the Committee.
4,51,Michael,The Committee is me.
4,51,Michael,I am Committee.
4,51,Michael,It me.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,What?
4,51,Michael,"They tricked me, and put me in charge of the Good Place, and then literally ran away."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And then what happened, the Sorting Hat put you in Hufflepuff?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Roasted.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, I know we have problems, but you can't expect me to ignore this."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hang on.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,We're in paradise.
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,Surely some people here are enjoying themselves.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"Hey, guys."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,I'm back.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Go-karting with monkeys got boring really fast.
4,51,Michael,It did?
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Damn it.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, no!"
4,51,Michael,"Jason, your lifelong dream got old that quickly?"
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"I mean, monkeys in go-karts was fun for a while."
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"Then I was like, ""Oh, you know what would be cool?"
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"Hippos in go-karts!"""
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"And I was like, ""Yo, what about Draculas with jet-packs?"""
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"I did, like, 50 combos, and then I just kinda wanted to hang out with you guys again."
4,51,Hypatia,"Okay, that's it, in a nutshell."
4,51,Hypatia,Cause you get here and you realize that anything is possible and you do everything and then you're done.
4,51,Hypatia,But you still have infinity left.
4,51,Hypatia,"This place kills fun, and passion, and excitement and love, till all you have left are milkshakes."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,The Good Place Committee obviously knew about this.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Why didn't they try and solve it?
4,51,Michael,They did.
4,51,Michael,They tried everything.
4,51,Michael,"Just last week, they made the unicorns bigger, and then they gave them more horns, and then they made them chubbier."
4,51,Michael,"I mean, really, they just made a bunch of weird, fluffy rhinos."
4,51,Michael,"The Committee members aren't human, so they couldn't understand the problem."
4,51,Michael,"The second I showed up, they jumped off this sinking ship and made me captain."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, I'm not giving up."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,We worked too hard and went through too much.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And I'm not just gonna sit back and turn into some slack-jawed, sweatpant-wearing orgasm machine!"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, my God!"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm describing my dream existence like it's bad.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,What is wrong with this place?
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"We just redesigned this system, and soon millions of people are going to start pouring in, thinking they're in paradise, only to become a joyless husk."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's Coachella!
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,We've invented Cosmic Coachella!
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Oh, we have to fix this."
4,51,Michael,What if we do what I did to you in the original neighborhood?
4,51,Michael,Erase their memory every once in a while.
4,51,Michael,"That way, paradise would seem fresh and and new."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,You were doing that to torture us.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,Actual paradise can't use the same playbook as hell.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, I have a solution."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Remember what I said to you when you were going through your ""midlife crisis, one earring, red convertible"" phase?"
4,51,Michael,"""You look so stupid""?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,After that.
4,51,Michael,"You said that, ""Every human is a little bit sad all the time because you know you're gonna die."
4,51,Michael,"But that knowledge is what gives life meaning."""
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,The way to restore meaning to the people in the Good Place is to let them leave.
4,51,Janet,Leave and go where?
4,51,Janet,This is the last oh.
4,51,Michael,Can we just do that?
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're the head of the Good Place now.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Seems to me you can do whatever you want.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where is Michael?
4,51,Michael,Okay.
4,51,Michael,Nothing to do but announce the big change.
4,51,Michael,"Whatever happens, it's cool, my babies."
4,51,Michael,It's very cool.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Did you smoke that weed, bud?"
4,51,Michael,I did.
4,51,Michael,"I was kinda freaked out, so I smoked some grass, but now I'm great."
4,51,Michael,"Let's change the afterlife, and then Taco Bell."
4,51,Michael,"Oh, baby!"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, I'm gonna do the talking."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, everyone."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Can I have your attention, please?"
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hi, my name's Eleanor Shellstrop."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hope you're having fun at our Flor-izona British Library Extravaganza.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I guess you don't really have fun anywhere, which is the point."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,It doesn't seem like this is paradise for you.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You've basically been on a never-ending vacation, and vacations are only special because they end."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"So, we have an idea."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"We're going to set up a new kind of door, um, somewhere peaceful."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"So that when you feel happy, and satisfied and complete and you want to leave the Good Place for good, you can just walk through it and your time in the universe will end."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You don't have to go through it, if you don't want to, but you can."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"And hopefully, knowing that you don't have to be here forever will help you feel happier while you are."
4,51,Paltibaal,What will happen when we go through it?
4,51,Janet,"Well, we don't really know, exactly."
4,51,Janet,"All we know is it will be peaceful, and your journey will be over."
4,51,Michael,You led great lives.
4,51,Michael,You earned your place here.
4,51,Michael,"So, stay here as long as you like."
4,51,Michael,Use the green doors to see and do every single thing you want to see and do.
4,51,Michael,"And when you're ready, walk through one last door and be at peace."
4,51,Michael,Does that sound good?
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Seems like they're into it.
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"It's DJ Music, make some noise!"
4,51,Janet,That's my boyfriend.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I'm glad you'll be able to enjoy things again.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Art, math, philosophy, like you used to."
4,51,Hypatia,"Yeah, me, too."
4,51,Hypatia,I've been dreaming of ending the ennui of this eternal existence for a long time.
4,51,Hypatia,"But now, I think I'll stick around for a while."
4,51,Hypatia,"It felt good to, uh make brain words."
4,51,Hypatia,Still mushy.
4,51,Hypatia,I'll get it back.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, we're lucky we ran into you."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,It saved us.
4,51,Hypatia,That's not what saved you.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hey!
4,51,Jason Mendoza,Hey!
4,51,Hypatia,It was your friendships.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, no, I got it."
4,51,Hypatia,Sorry.
4,51,Hypatia,Still not sharp.
4,51,Michael,Kept most of it the same.
4,51,Michael,Even made myself an office nearby.
4,51,Michael,"Jason, I I kinda took a wild guess"
4,51,Jason Mendoza,I finally get to accomplish my goal of living in a Stupid Nick's!
4,51,Jason Mendoza,"I know anything you do for eternity gets boring, but I swear, I will never get sick of wings."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, I'll see you all tomorrow."
4,51,Tahani Al-Jamil,And every tomorrow after that.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, Michael, at the end of the day, you were right."
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,Everything is fine.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,This is what we've been looking for since the day we met time.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I guess that's what the Good Place really is.
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,"It's not even a ""place"", really."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,It's just having enough time with the people you love.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're right.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,And we have as long as we want.
4,51,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If you keep hogging this blanket, I'm probably gonna walk through that door in, like, three days, though."
4,51,Chidi Anagonye,I'll miss you.
4,52,Michael,Attempt number 803 of my new project.
4,52,Michael,This is the one.
4,52,Michael,I can feel it.
4,52,Michael,I'm ready.
4,52,Michael,And here we go.
4,52,Michael,"Riding on a groovy wave of love, I'm going for a cosmic ride."
4,52,Michael,"Surf the freaky purple vibes of love, the marshmallow cat is inside."
4,52,Michael,"""Marshmallow cat is inside""?"
4,52,Michael,That's what I wrote?
4,52,Michael,That's meaningless.
4,52,Michael,Janet.
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Janet,How's the songwriting going?
4,52,Michael,I'm completely lost here and I can't do the stupid E chord.
4,52,Janet,Would you like a magic guitar that plays all the notes for you?
4,52,Janet,It's the number one request among men over 50 who have gotten in here.
4,52,Michael,"No, the whole point is to learn how to do stuff without using afterlife magic."
4,52,Michael,"You know, maybe keep it on deck."
4,52,Michael,I don't know.
4,52,Michael,Whatever.
4,52,Janet,"We should go, by the way."
4,52,Janet,We're gonna be late.
4,52,Michael,"Oh, where does the time go?"
4,52,Michael,Surf the freaky purple vibes
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"So, ultimately, this all goes back to the line from Professor May's book, ""Mortality offers meaning to our lives and morality helps navigate that meaning."""
4,52,Todd May,"Wait, what I think it says is that, ""Mortality offers meaning to the events of our lives."""
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, check yourself, rando."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think Chidi Anagonye, who literally designed the afterlife, knows what he's talking about."
4,52,Todd May,"Look, I'm pretty sure I'm right since it's, like, my book."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Uh, yes, Professor May, you're probably right about what you wrote."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Still think he should check himself.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, everyone."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,We'll see you all here next week.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Professor Hieronymi will be teaching the trolley problem.
4,52,Pamela Hieronymi,Bring ponchos.
4,52,Pamela Hieronymi,It gets messy.
4,52,Michael,"You ready, Chidi?"
4,52,Michael,"Hello, Jeff."
4,52,Michael,See the collection's grown.
4,52,Jeff,"Yeah, sure has."
4,52,Jeff,I have 322 frog things now.
4,52,Jeff,Three twenty-three.
4,52,Jeff,I just got another one!
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Never not excited about frogs, that guy."
4,52,Michael,He knows what he likes.
4,52,Judge,This meeting of the Joint Council of Afterlife Affairs is called to order.
4,52,Judge,"Let's make this quick, kids."
4,52,Judge,I just started rewatching The Leftovers.
4,52,Judge,"Honestly, when I found out that Carrie Coon was never nominated, I almost erased 2% of humanity."
4,52,Judge,"Michael, update."
4,52,Michael,Things are going fairly well.
4,52,Michael,A new crop of humans just passed their tests.
4,52,Michael,"Among the notables who got in, Roberto Clemente, Zora Neale Hurston, Saint Thomas Aquinas"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yes!
4,52,Michael, eighth-century Sufi mystic poet Hazrat Bibi Rabia Basri and Clara Peller.
4,52,Michael,"She was the ""Where's the Beef?"" lady."
4,52,Judge,Oh.
4,52,Michael,"""Where's the Beef?"" lady got in."
4,52,Michael,"So, that's fun."
4,52,Michael,"Honestly, our biggest problem is that we need more architects and actors."
4,52,Vicky,"Well, sorry, but these younger demon actors have no dedication to their craft."
4,52,Vicky,They think they can just start acting.
4,52,Vicky,They have to learn that acting is reacting.
4,52,Vicky,And reacting is pre-acting.
4,52,Vicky,But pre-acting?
4,52,Vicky,"Well, that's just being."
4,52,Judge,"Okay, take it down a notch, Daniel Day-Lewis."
4,52,Judge,Shawn?
4,52,Judge,What ya got?
4,52,Shawn,"Well, I'll begin by saying that this new system stinks, and Michael stinks, and we should throw this all in the garbage and go back to the way it used to be when everyone was tortured."
4,52,Michael,"There's still some bumps in the road, but this system is good and it's working."
4,52,Michael,"Come on, admit it."
4,52,Shawn,"I will never ever, ever, ever, ever ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever ever admit that."
4,52,Michael,"I know, buddy."
4,52,Michael,I know.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,What time is it?
4,52,Janet,I don't know.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Really?
4,52,Janet,Yeah.
4,52,Janet,"At one point, hundreds of Bearimys ago, I turned off my ability to know what time it is anywhere in the universe when you and I are together."
4,52,Janet,I like not knowing.
4,52,Janet,It's 10:42 a.m.
4,52,Janet,"Sorry, saying out loud that I didn't know something made me feel weird."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Man, I feel weird when I do know something."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,You and I are very different.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, gotta go meet my dad."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna try one more time.
4,52,Janet,Good luck.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Thanks.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Ugh, I'm freaking out, man."
4,52,Donkey Doug,"You got this, dawg."
4,52,Donkey Doug,One more play for all the marbles.
4,52,Donkey Doug,I love you and I believe in you.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Thanks, Dad."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, here we go."
4,52,Commentator,Bortles gonna throw yes!
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I did it!
4,52,Donkey Doug,You did it!
4,52,Donkey Doug,"It took you more than 433,000 tries, but you just played the perfect game of Madden!"
4,52,Donkey Doug,You did it!
4,52,Donkey Doug,That's my boy.
4,52,Donkey Doug,That's my boy.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I did it.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Okay.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Janet?
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Hi, Janet."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I made dinner.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"You always make it for me, so this time I wanted to make it."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"And real talk, it didn't go great."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,This is spaghetti.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Now, I know it looks weird, but I bit off a chunk, and actually, it's pretty bad."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Also, I put out the forks and knives the way kings and queens do it."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Close to the plates.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Also --
4,52,Janet,Uh-oh.
4,52,Janet,"Oh, dip."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Yeah.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,So I need to talk to everyone.
4,52,Janet,Should I ask them to come here?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"No, I I had a better idea."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Hello, you two."
4,52,Janet,Hi.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,What fun meeting back here!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You even restored it to the way it used to look.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What inspired this, J-Dawg?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You get a hankering for frozen yogurt?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,No.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I have an announcement to make.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I'm leaving.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Going through the door.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Wow.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Are you sure?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Yeah, I am."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,It's time.
4,52,Janet,We thought the best move was to gather everyone together for a sort of farewell party.
4,52,Janet,"We're gonna eat and drink, and there will be dancing"
4,52,Michael,Fun.
4,52,Michael,Whee!
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, homies, you're sad."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I can tell 'cause you have the same looks on your faces that my teachers did whenever I raised my hand in class.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,But let's be happy.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I'm gonna DJ.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,We'll play EDM all night.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Come on.
4,52,Janet,Come on.
4,52,Michael,Ah!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oof!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, I'm bummed about two things."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey there, Doug."
4,52,Doug Forcett,Hi.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Having fun?
4,52,Doug Forcett,I've had so much chicken.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,It's probably good you chose your young body.
4,52,Doug Forcett,Yeah.
4,52,Michael,How are you doing?
4,52,Janet,"I'm okay, Michael."
4,52,Janet,How are you?
4,52,Michael,Well I'm sad.
4,52,Michael,"And I know you're the most advanced being in the universe, but I feel like I need to tell you it's okay if you're sad, too."
4,52,Janet,I know.
4,52,Janet,"And I am a little, but also, I know this is the right time for him to leave."
4,52,Janet,I really am okay.
4,52,Janet,I promise.
4,52,Michael,Will you come talk to me if you're not?
4,52,Janet,Always.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,How y'all doin' tonight?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Okay, homies, we got a real special treat."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"My old dance crew, Dance Dance Resolution, is here!"
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Y'all ready to tear it up one last time?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,What?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yes!
4,52,Jason Mendoza,That was special.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I'll never forget this night until I walk through the door and dissolve into the universe.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Can I ask you something, buddy?"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,How did you know?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Look, it wasn't like I heard a bell ring or anything."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"I just suddenly had this calm feeling, like the air inside my lungs was the same as the air outside my body."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,It was peaceful.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"You know the feeling when you think a jalapeno popper is gonna be too hot, but you bite into it anyway and it's actually the perfect temperature?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Believe it or not, I do know that feeling."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That feeling rules.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,There you go.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Uh can I get your advice on something?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I'm scared Janet's gonna forget me.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Her falling in love with someone else, I'm fine with that."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Like if Jason Momoa or if Lara Croft, Tomb Raider gets in, and Janet's like, ""That's what's up!"""
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Totally cool.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,But her forgetting me would be sad.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"So, I made her this."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,What do you guys think?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,It's lovely.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"But she's not gonna forget you, man."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"I mean, she she literally can't."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,She remembers everything that ever happened.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Even if she could forget someone, I don't think she's gonna forget you."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Thanks.
4,52,Donkey Doug,"When I had Jason, I was 18 years old."
4,52,Donkey Doug,"In many ways, Jason raised me just as much as I raised him."
4,52,Donkey Doug,"So, thanks for being a great dad, son!"
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"I love you, Dad!"
4,52,Pillboi,Jason is the realest dude ever.
4,52,Pillboi,"I mean, none of us are real anymore."
4,52,Pillboi,We're all just Caspers the Ghosts and whatnot.
4,52,Pillboi,"Which is funny, because me and Jason ain't even white."
4,52,Pillboi,Why are all ghosts white?
4,52,Pillboi,"Oh, dip, are ghosts racist?"
4,52,Pillboi,"What I'm trying to say is, ""I love you, dawg."
4,52,Pillboi,You're my hero.
4,52,Pillboi,You're my best friend.
4,52,Pillboi,"And you're my guard to Minshew."""
4,52,Janet,You can sit on that bench as long as you want.
4,52,Janet,"Whenever you're ready, you just walk through."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"I love you, Janet."
4,52,Janet,"I love you, too, Jason."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I hope you have a nice rest of eternity.
4,52,Janet,Mmm.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I made you something.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip, I lost it."
4,52,Janet,It's okay.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"No, it's not."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I made you this cool thing so you'll remember me even when you're married to Aquaman.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,And I lost it somewhere in this forest.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Some magical squirrel probably ate it.
4,52,Janet,"Jason, it's okay."
4,52,Janet,I'm never gonna forget you.
4,52,Janet,"In fact, to me, you won't even really be gone."
4,52,Janet,I don't experience time the same way you do.
4,52,Janet,I kind of live all times at once.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I know what you mean.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Once, I smoked salvia and saw the past and the future at the same time."
4,52,Janet,Hmm.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Then I tried to brush my teeth with my cat.
4,52,Janet,"To me, remembering moments with you is the same as living in them."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Could you just remember the happy times and forget the bad stuff?
4,52,Janet,There was no bad stuff.
4,52,Janet,It was all good.
4,52,Nick Offerman,Oh.
4,52,Nick Offerman,These spindles are gorgeous.
4,52,Nick Offerman,And there's almost a feeling of musculature to this transition.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,The oak just sort of told me the shape before I even got to the spokeshave.
4,52,Nick Offerman,This under-bevel is a great trick.
4,52,Nick Offerman,"It really makes it feel lighter, while leaving you plenty of beef to carve."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,It's really just a modified Danish line.
4,52,Nick Offerman,"Still, you made it your own."
4,52,Nick Offerman,This is as good a chair as I've seen.
4,52,Nick Offerman,I've nothing left to teach you.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ah!
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Hurrah!
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Thank you.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet.
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Call up the list, please."
4,52,Janet,Congratulations.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Actually, I just finished repaving my driveway yesterday."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"So, cross that one off, too."
4,52,Janet,"Before you start your next project, you should know, that thing you asked me to tell you when it happened?"
4,52,Janet,It happened.
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"I mean, they've gone through the system so they'll be a little different, right?"
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,One would hope.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've never had lunch with Mum and Dad.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've only ever stood silently behind their chairs while they ate lobster tail with Oscar de la Renta.
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,I'm right here.
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,We will get through this together.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Here we go.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Mother, Father, welcome to --"
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,My darlings!
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,My darlings.
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,"Oh, my little girls!"
4,52,Waqas Al-Jamil,We love you both so much!
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,So very much!
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,We have a million things to talk to you about.
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,"But first, we are sorry."
4,52,Manisha Al-Jamil,"We'll just be endlessly sorry, forever and ever."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Holy crap.
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"I know, right?"
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Ugh!
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,For the one millionth time they've sent us teddy bears and flowers.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,You think they'd understand we can get these things ourselves if we want.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Ah, that's lovely."
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,Thanks.
4,52,Kamilah Al-Jamil,"You know, I never thought I would say this, but I'm getting a little bored of Mom and Dad telling us how much they love us."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Yes.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Isn't that something?
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, this may not come as a surprise to any of you, but I'm ready to go."
4,52,Michael,"Oh, nuts."
4,52,Michael,I knew it.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,You finished everything on your list?
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I learned how to install a bathtub, fly a helicopter, defuse a bomb, deliver the perfect backhand slice."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My last goal was to spend one meaningful day with my parents, and now I've spent thousands of them."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I feel complete.
4,52,Janet,Would you like me to prepare a farewell party for you?
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,No need.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've done it myself.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I've cooked all the food, mixed all the drinks, made all the furniture, repainted all the walls, and trained all the animals."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, sure."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Thank you, panda."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Also, I've already said goodbye to everyone else in my life."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"My sister, my parents Bey and Jay, who took it very hard."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Tonight, it's just us."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I hate to tell you this, but your risotto was a little sticky."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Was it?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, damn it, it was amazing."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Just trying to figure out a way to get you to hang around for a few more Bearimys.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Can I tell you something?
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,You're my role model.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm serious.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Babe, you were already the most impressive person I ever met, and now you can do literally everything."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If that's true, it's because you inspired me."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I admire you so very much.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Your strength, your toughness, your self-esteem, not to mention you have a rockin' bod."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Did you just turn the tables on me?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I got nothin' left to teach you.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Janet.
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"One more goal to add to the list, please."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Now, cross it off."
4,52,John Wheaton,I know we already said goodbye.
4,52,John Wheaton,I'm not even here.
4,52,John Wheaton,I just had to see you one last time because I hooked up with Alexander the Great.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Oh.
4,52,John Wheaton,And it was more like Alexander the Fine.
4,52,John Wheaton,Okay.
4,52,John Wheaton,"Anyway, I love you, I love you, goodbye forever."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Bye, love!"
4,52,John Wheaton,Bye.
4,52,Michael,I admire your breadth of knowledge.
4,52,Michael,"I can only do one thing, be an architect."
4,52,Michael,I've spent the last 500 Bearimys trying to learn how to play the guitar.
4,52,Michael,"And I just mastered ""Hey There Delilah""."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Don't sell yourself short, Michael."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I dare say you're the greatest architect in existence.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,And I should know --
4,52,All,Frank Gehry is my godfather.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Fair enough.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I deserved that.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, Tahani, I'm gonna miss you, babe."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Wait.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I don't want to leave.
4,52,Michael,Great.
4,52,Michael,"Then, stay."
4,52,Michael,"New party, everyone."
4,52,Michael,A a staying party.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, I also don't want to stay."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I'm done here, but I don't want to go there."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,It's kind of your only options.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"No, they aren't."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I want to learn to do what you do, Michael."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I want to be an architect, design afterlives."
4,52,Michael,"Tahani, you're a wonderful person but you're a person."
4,52,Michael,It's impossible.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Nonsense.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"I can learn, just like I learned all this other stuff."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I've spent most of my life pretending to help people.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"If I were an architect, I could do it for real."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Let me at least try.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Don't make me talk to your manager.
4,52,All,Oh!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's my girl!
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Oh!
4,52,Michael,"Hey, Jeff."
4,52,Michael,"Boy, kind of getting away from you here, huh?"
4,52,Jeff,Yeah.
4,52,Jeff,"I love frogs though, so it's awesome."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I did bring you one.
4,52,Jeff,"Oh, thanks, Tahani."
4,52,Jeff,Just toss it on the pile.
4,52,Brent Norwalk,"Wait, hang on, hang on."
4,52,Brent Norwalk,So you can never tell a woman to smile?
4,52,Brent Norwalk,What if she'd legitimately be prettier if she smiled?
4,52,Brent Norwalk,Aren't I helping her?
4,52,Michael,"Glenn, Beadie, this is your new intern, Tahani."
4,52,Glenn,Tahani!
4,52,Glenn,This is so neat.
4,52,Glenn,I I haven't seen you since I was exploded into goo.
4,52,Glenn,"I didn't get any me on you, did I?"
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"You did, but it's all goo under the bridge."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Anyway, I want to learn everything."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I shall start at the bottom and earn my way up.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"To wit, would anyone like a cup of antimatter?"
4,52,Beadie,"Sure, I take mine with non-dairy neutrinos."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Coming right up.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Thank you, Michael, for everything."
4,52,Michael,You're welcome.
4,52,Michael,"I brought you a little ""first day on the job"" present."
4,52,Michael,"Once you're a big deal around here, I hope you don't mind if I brag about knowing you."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Name dropping is a little gauche, Michael, but do as you must."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task."""
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Boom!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I did it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"It only took me 2,000 Bearimys, but I finally finished that book."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sucker!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Reading you was an unending task, but I freaking did it!"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Congrats, babe."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Thanks.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,What are you reading?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,The Da Vinci Code.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"After a thousand lifetimes of reading the most difficult writings in the world, I've acquired a new passion: garbage books!"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Hey, do you think I would have been a good symbologist if that were a real job?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, I do."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're very cute.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, we gotta go to dinner."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Oh.
4,52,Simone Garnett,I cannot believe she learned to cook this well.
4,52,Simone Garnett,"When I first met Tahani on Earth, she was trying to shove jewelry into a vending machine."
4,52,Madison,"Okay, well, if she is an architect, then she should design my idea."
4,52,Madison,A karaoke room that's also a tanning bed.
4,52,Brittany,"Ooh, yes."
4,52,Brittany,"And, like, the harder you commit to the song, like, the tanner you get."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I gotta say, I am so glad that going through the system did not totally change you two dingdongs."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, for dessert, we have to get the tiramisu."
4,52,Uzo,"Man, Chidi Anagonye, just casually making choices."
4,52,Uzo,I never thought I'd live to see it.
4,52,Uzo,"I mean, I guess I didn't."
4,52,Brittany,"Oh, that's right, 'cause we're all dead!"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was so fun.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, it's always fun to see them."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Every time we do it, it's fun."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I had coffee with my mom the other day, and she says hi."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But she also finally learned how to pronounce your mom's name, which is good."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,They were joking about that last time we saw them.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Remember?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, right."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Shakespeare went through the door.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Everyone's talking about it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,It's probably for the best.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"His last 4,000 plays were not nearly as good as the ones he wrote on Earth."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I mean, did you see The Tempest Two: Here We Blow Again?"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Woof!
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Do you mind if we go home?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I'm tired.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Sure.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Okay.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Uh I'm gonna get ready for bed.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Cool, I'm gonna take a little stroll."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll see you in a bit.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Dude!
4,52,Michael,"Oh, hey."
4,52,Michael,Perfect.
4,52,Michael,Are these good lyrics?
4,52,Michael,The psychedelic stardust and moonbeam banana --
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, stop."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's terrible.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,And we got a problem.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think Chidi's gonna leave.
4,52,Michael,Really?
4,52,Michael,Did he say he was ready?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He didn't say exactly that, but he's getting close."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I can tell.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I I need to do something to shake things up, you know, light a spark."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Oh.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet?
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hi.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Um, I think Chidi's almost ready to walk through the door, and I need to keep him here, so, um, can you make me a bed shaped like a giant highlighter, and, like, a sexy, edible valedictorian robe?"
4,52,Michael,"No, I think this calls for something spiritual."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ah, okay, but if I do this right, my man's gonna be talking to God, you know what I mean?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Wait, what do you mean?"
4,52,Janet,"Forgive me, Eleanor, but if Chidi's ready to go it's time for him to go."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Uh, he didn't say that yet, though."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,We're we're in classic Chidi gray area.
4,52,Michael,You need to remind him of what's great about this place.
4,52,Michael,"Oh, oh, remember where he took us, like, the first month we were all together?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, great idea."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yes!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Janet, set the scene."
4,52,Janet,Okay.
4,52,Janet,Would you like it restored to its original glory?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,No.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"First time he went, he was in college."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Have it look and feel exactly like it was that day when he fell in love with it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Also, pack me the edible robe."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That might seal the deal.
4,52,Janet,"Okay, you're all set."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, guess what?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Surprise trip, come on."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Surprise trip?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Now?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Special fun trip, just us two."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let's go.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Can I change out of my pajamas first?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Let the door do it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Come on!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Come on, come on, come on!"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Okay, okay."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh oh, man, Eleanor."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,We haven't been here in so long.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Athens.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Man, this city, it takes my breath away every time."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Talk it out, bud."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tell me everything you know about this place.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because, full disclosure, I didn't really listen the first time you told me."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Well, I mean that's the Acropolis."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, and this is the Pnyx."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Thousands of Athenians would gather here and listen to people discuss their city and its laws from that stage right there.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,This is literally where democracy started.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, that's fine and dandy, but as you may know, I'm kind of a philosophy gal."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Where were the big brains hanging out?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes they all gathered right here in the Agora."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"It was like the Avengers, but for super thinkers."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, come on, you brought me here."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,You knew what was gonna happen.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, I love that you're so happy."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hey, let me ask you something."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Is it weird that when I picture Ancient Greeks I make them really hot?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Like, to me, Aristotle is basically John Stamos with a beard."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Honestly, that's kinda how I picture him, too."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Good, same page."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,What's this called again?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Kouluvri""?"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Koulouri.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Man, I lived on these when I was here."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I like to picture a young Chidi Anagonye here, reading, nerding out, treating himself to a koulouri if he had an astute insight into Aristotelian virtue ethics."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, that is accurate."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,That is an accurate picture of 20-year-old me.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,This was so special.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Thank you.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Should we head home?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Nope, because we're not done yet."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,There's more special trip.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Janet.
4,52,Janet,"Hi, there."
4,52,Janet,"You enjoying your trip, Chidi?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, we are, uh, but it's not over yet."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"We are ready to head to destination number two, remember?"
4,52,Janet,"Yes, of course."
4,52,Janet,Head right this way.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, man."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Oh, wow."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Paris.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Yes, Paris."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Obviously.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,My favorite city.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,And you even picked the ideal weather.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Overcast and chilly.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Perfect for staying inside and reading.
4,52,Janet,Is this what you were hinting to me?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was thinking Six Flags, but this is way better."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I used to come to this cafe every day when I lived here.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"I tried to sit in a different seat each time, so I could eventually say that I definitely sat in the exact same place as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Richard Wright, Brecht, James Baldwin"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, we got all the time in the world now, baby."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Put that booty in a seat warmed by history.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Eleanor, I know what you're doing."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Being the best eternal girlfriend ever?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Guilty.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Let's take a walk.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"So, Eleanor, here it is."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I love you completely and utterly --
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, crap."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,But I have to go.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But you don't, though."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't have to go.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You don't have to leave me.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I I don't want to leave you.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I'm just ready to leave.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"I have the same feeling that the others described, a kind of quietude in my soul."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,But you just had it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"What if those other dummies didn't wait long enough and the feeling fades, and you get to spend another billion Bearimys in fake afterlife Europe with your kickass girlfriend?"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I didn't just have it.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I've had it a long time.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Remember that day we were with our parents?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"My mom kissed you goodbye and got lipstick on your cheek, and your mom rubbed it off."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"I don't know why that was it, but that was it."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"And I didn't want to tell you, because because"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, man, this can't be."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Because Jason's gone, Tahani's off doing her thing and I'm not ready to go."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So if you leave, then I'm alone here."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was alone my whole life and I told myself I like it that way, but I don't."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I like being with you.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Okay.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I won't go.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"Yeah, I won't go."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,There's there is still plenty to do.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I'll stay.
4,52,Janet,Who's ready for Six Flags?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Oh, we're good."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,We got it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's gonna stay.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, what do you wanna do?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Turn into birds and fly to Notre Dame?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Stand at the top of the Eiffel Tower and throw water balloons onto imaginary tourists?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Whatever you want to do.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, well, let's freshen up, have dinner at some schmancy restaurant, order a million-dollar bottle of wine, even though it tastes exactly like cheap, stupid wine, and sit in a room at the Georges Cinq and watch Real Housewives of whatever city they're doing that in now."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Love it.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,See where I used to live.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Meet you at the restaurant?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Yeah.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,All right.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Let's see what's on the menu.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"""Literally anything you could possibly imagine."""
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Hmm.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,What are you thinking?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"""Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task."""
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what I was thinking about.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That sentence.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,You wanna eat that sentence for dinner?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Can we eat words?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Cause I asked Janet about this and --
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"No, no, it's the last line of Scanlon's book, remember?"
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Ah.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"The whole book is about how we should try to find rules other people can't reasonably reject, and then he ends it by saying, the search for how to find those rules will go on forever."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I proposed a rule that Chidis shouldn't be allowed to leave because it would make Eleanors sad.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I could do this forever.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Zip you around the universe, showing you cool stuff, and I'd still never find the justification for getting you to stay because it's a selfish rule."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I owe it to you to let you go.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I was never good at being sad, partly because my mom straight up told me not to be."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But this is sad, man."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You got a John Locke quote or a piece of Kantian wisdom you can throw at me?
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Those guys were more focused on rules and regulations.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"For spiritual stuff, you gotta turn to the East."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'll take anything you got.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Hit me.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Picture a wave in the ocean.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"You can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through and it's there, and you can see it, and you know what it is, it's a wave."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,And then it crashes on the shore and it's gone.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,But the water is still there.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"The wave was just a a different way for the water to be, for a little while."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"That's one conception of death, for a Buddhist."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"The wave returns to the ocean where it came from, and where it's supposed to be."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Not bad, Buddhists."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Not bad.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,None of this is bad.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I need you to do me one last favor.
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,Mmm-hmm?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Say goodbye to me now.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Then leave before I wake up.
4,52,Janet,"You can sit on that bench as long as you'd like and whenever you're ready, you just walk through."
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,I'm ready.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Oh, dip!"
4,52,Jason Mendoza,You're back.
4,52,Janet,Jason?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Yeah!
4,52,Janet,What but how why
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Funny story.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,Remember how I made you something
4,52,Janet,Uh-huh.
4,52,Jason Mendoza, and I thought I lost it because it wasn't in my pocket?
4,52,Janet,Uh-huh?
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Turns out, it was in my other pocket."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"By the time I found it, you were gone."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"I was just gonna leave it for you, but I was worried it would get eaten by that magic squirrel, so I decided to wait for you to come back."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Every so often, a different Janet came, but I knew it wasn't you."
4,52,Janet,"Jason, it's been, like, 1,000 Bearimys."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I know.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,But I wanted to see you again.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,It was actually pretty easy to wait.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,I sort of just sat quietly and let my mind drift away thought about you and the infinity of the universe.
4,52,Janet,Kind of like a monk.
4,52,Jason Mendoza,What do you mean?
4,52,Janet,Um
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Looks good, not-a-girl."
4,52,Jason Mendoza,"Chidi, wait up."
4,52,Michael,Hey-o!
4,52,Michael,"Time to go nuts, because I brought doughnuts!"
4,52,Michael,Huh!
4,52,Michael,No one's here?
4,52,Michael,Shoot.
4,52,Michael,That was gonna be a big laugh.
4,52,Judge,"Hey, sweetie."
4,52,Judge,Did you not get the message?
4,52,Michael,No.
4,52,Michael,"Why, was the, uh, meeting canceled?"
4,52,Judge,"Uh, yeah, forever."
4,52,Judge,We dissolved the council.
4,52,Michael,What?
4,52,Judge,We don't need it anymore.
4,52,Judge,Your system's working perfectly.
4,52,Judge,"Millions of humans passing their tests, you know."
4,52,Judge,"Oh, Vicky's really killing it on the training."
4,52,Judge,"So, it's all good."
4,52,Michael,"Well, you all right, well, hang on."
4,52,Michael,"Look, how are we even sure that this is the right system?"
4,52,Michael,"I mean, honestly, I think Shawn was right."
4,52,Michael,"This whole thing sucks, and we should start from scratch."
4,52,Judge,"Relax, worrywart."
4,52,Judge,"Take a load off, huh?"
4,52,Judge,Enjoy yourself.
4,52,Judge,You know what I just discovered recently?
4,52,Judge,Podcasts.
4,52,Judge,"There's, like, a billion of them and they just keep coming."
4,52,Michael,Hmm.
4,52,Judge,"Now, scoot!"
4,52,Judge,I got a new Radiolab to listen to about how clams learn.
4,52,Michael,Hmm.
4,52,Judge,Pretty excited.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I love you.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,And you don't need to respond 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel --
4,52,Chidi Anagonye,"I love you, too."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Knock, knock, knock."
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Oh.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Hey, what's up?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Can I talk to you for a sec?
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Yeah, sure, why not?"
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Hey, Derek?"
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,"Yes, Mindy?"
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,What can Derek do for you?
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Uh, Eleanor and I are gonna talk for a bit, so go into your nethersphere."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's Derek?
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,Mindy has rebooted Derek more than 151 million times.
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,"Derek is now both a singular point in space, and yet Derek also contains space itself."
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,The nexus of Derek is without dimension.
4,52,Derek Hofstetler,The moment of Derek's creation and the eventual heat death of the universe are now inexorably the same.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Ugh, you are so annoying!"
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Want a beer?
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"So that's how you spend your days, wandering around, searching for the thing that makes you complete?"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Pretty much.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought it was connected to my parents or my friends.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,But now I think it might be something else.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think it might be you.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think my final mission might be to convince you to go through the system.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Take the test.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, when I first met you, I thought ""Well, there's a chick I understand."""
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Lone wolf, totally independent, knows what she wants."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Cocaine and self-pleasure.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Cocaine and self-pleasure.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Right.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,But I actually think you're a version of me if I'd never met my friends.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're, like, the worst-case scenario of what I could've become."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,No offense.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,None taken.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"Look, the thing is, Eleanor, I am fine with where I am."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"See, I don't think you are."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Or at least, you could be better."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"If we're cut from the same cloth, then trust me, there's a greater happiness waiting for you if you form bonds with other people."
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Ugh.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,And I think you know that.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You told me about me and Chidi that time.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You showed me the tape.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You said you were rooting for us.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I think you have the ability to care.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,I don't know.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Caring just seems like a lot of work.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,And I have been on my own for so long.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,I I can't imagine putting my fate in the hands of some stranger.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I thought you might say that.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Hello, gorgeous."
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Eleanor!
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,And Mindy St. Claire!
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,As I neither live nor breathe.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,What brings you ladies here?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm trying to convince Mindy to enter the system after all this time.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,She's a little worried about who might end up designing her test.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,Say no more.
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,I'm on the case.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Really?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Are you, like, certified or whatever?"
4,52,Tahani Al-Jamil,"Well, not yet, but it won't be long, right, Shawn?"
4,52,Shawn,"Oh, I think you'll find that Tahani will be certified very soon."
4,52,Shawn,Did that sound evil?
4,52,Shawn,I didn't mean it to.
4,52,Shawn,I was sincere.
4,52,Shawn,Force of habit.
4,52,Shawn,"I do think you'll find that Tahani will be certified very shut up, Glenn!"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Great.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"So, you go back to your old life, chill with your floating Derek head."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"When Tahani gets certified, you enter the system, Tahani designs your test."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Deal?
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Why not?
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Something new.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,Thanks for giving a crap about me.
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,"I don't really give a crap about myself, so it's nice that someone does."
4,52,Mindy St. Claire,I'm really glad I filmed you having sex.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Me, too."
4,52,Janet,You can sit on that bench as long as you want.
4,52,Janet,"Whenever you're ready, you just walk through."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Well, good, because I'm definitely ready."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm ready.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I'm not ready.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Damn it, Janet."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the fork?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I should be ready and I'm not.
4,52,Michael,But I am.
4,52,Janet,"Michael, what are you doing?"
4,52,Michael,I'm going through the door.
4,52,Michael,There's nothing left for me to do.
4,52,Michael,I feel sated and complete.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I'm not sure you're thinking this through, dude."
4,52,Michael,"Yes, I am."
4,52,Michael,"A calm has washed over me blah, blah, blah."
4,52,Michael,Goodbye.
4,52,Michael,Did I go through the wrong way?
4,52,Michael,"Wait, wait, just one this is gonna look silly, but it probably will work"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, what are you doing?"
4,52,Michael,I am returning my damn essence to the damn fabric of the damn universe.
4,52,Michael,"Oh, yeah."
4,52,Michael,Okay.
4,52,Michael,"Oh, there we go."
4,52,Michael,It's working now.
4,52,Michael,It's working.
4,52,Michael,I'm leaving.
4,52,Michael,Bye!
4,52,Michael,"It's not working, because you're looking."
4,52,Michael,Stop looking!
4,52,Janet,"Michael, that door is not for you."
4,52,Michael,Why not?
4,52,Michael,I invented the damn thing.
4,52,Michael,"You know, this stinks!"
4,52,Michael,"You guys get to move on, but I am trapped here forever?"
4,52,Michael,How is that fair?
4,52,Michael,Oh!
4,52,Michael,I got it!
4,52,Michael,"Eleanor, come here"
4,52,Michael,"You go through, and give me a piggy-back."
4,52,Michael,We can trick it.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Ooh, no, ow."
4,52,Janet,Michael.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Ow!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, no!"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Michael!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"All right, come with me."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Fire squids are heavy!
4,52,Janet,Yeah.
4,52,Michael,Sorry.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,New people are getting in all the time.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Tahani's still around.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Maybe team up with her, design some afterlife neighborhoods?"
4,52,Michael,"I did that already, remember?"
4,52,Michael,Spent 50 Bearimys making new neighborhoods for new residents.
4,52,Michael,"When you've already designed the ultimate one, it's kind of a letdown."
4,52,Michael,"I've loved being here, but Jason's gone, Chidi's gone."
4,52,Michael,"You know, even Doug Forcett went through the door."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That was probably for the best.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That guy partied so hard when he was here.
4,52,Michael,"I guess I'll just stay here forever, you know, putter around, doing mundane things, like some sad, old retiree."
4,52,Michael,"Maybe I'll have Janet make me a hardware store, so I can buy a hex wrench that I don't really need."
4,52,Judge,Cockamamie!
4,52,Judge,"That's what I think of your plan, I think it's cockamamie!"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I think it's a great plan, and I bet deep down you do too."
4,52,Judge,It sets a bad precedent.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Babe!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,No one else is ever gonna wanna do this.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Plus, if they ask, you just say, ""Sure, pal, go save every soul in the universe and then we got a deal."""
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And think about it this way, if you do this, you'll never have to hear from any of us ever again."
4,52,Judge,Ooh.
4,52,Judge,"Now that is tempting, 'cause y'all are annoying."
4,52,Judge,"I mean, you did save the universe and all, but your tone it's your tone."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I know.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Michael, come on in."
4,52,Michael,All my Earth stuff!
4,52,Michael,Oh!
4,52,Michael,My old bowling ball.
4,52,Michael,Oh!
4,52,Michael,"Hi, paper clips!"
4,52,Michael,What prompted all this?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You know, it took me a while to figure it out."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But earlier when you were walking back and forth through the door, it hit me."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You will never be at peace until you get the one thing you truly want.
4,52,Michael,I'm I'm gonna be
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"A real boy, Pinocchio."
4,52,Janet,The Judge gave me the power to make you an actual human.
4,52,Janet,"Goodbye, fire squid."
4,52,Janet,"Hello, silver fox."
4,52,Michael,"Oh, Eleanor!"
4,52,Michael,"Oh, my goodness!"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Now, you need to be sure about this."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"You're gonna live down there for, like some amount of time, you'll die, really die, then you'll enter an afterlife test, be judged on what you did, the whole deal."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"At least, so we think."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"While you're down there, this entire system could be changed."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Shawn might launch a coup.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Someone could design a whole new system.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You won't really know what's gonna happen to you.
4,52,Michael,That's what makes it special.
4,52,Michael,I won't exactly know what's going to happen after I die.
4,52,Michael,Nothing more human than that.
4,52,Michael,Besides texting people that you're five minutes away when you haven't even left the house.
4,52,Michael,"Thank you, Eleanor."
4,52,Michael,Thank you.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,You're very welcome.
4,52,Jeff,"Hey, Mike."
4,52,Jeff,Where you headed today?
4,52,Michael,"Earth, actually."
4,52,Jeff,Oh!
4,52,Jeff,Been a while.
4,52,Jeff,Here's the return clicker.
4,52,Michael,No need.
4,52,Michael,One-way trip.
4,52,Jeff,Wow.
4,52,Jeff,Okay.
4,52,Jeff,Good luck.
4,52,Michael,Thank you.
4,52,Michael,I have something for you.
4,52,Jeff,Uh-huh.
4,52,Jeff,He's real!
4,52,Jeff,It's real.
4,52,Jeff,He's a real frog!
4,52,Michael,"Yes, it sure is."
4,52,Jeff,Thank you.
4,52,Jeff,You know what?
4,52,Jeff,I got the perfect name for him Mr. Jumpy Legs.
4,52,Michael,Oh.
4,52,Michael,I thought you were gonna never mind.
4,52,Jeff,"Hello, Mr. Jumpy Legs."
4,52,Janet,"Okay, so here's your driver's license and your social security card."
4,52,Janet,I set up a bank account for you.
4,52,Janet,"There's enough money in there so that you don't starve, but not so much that you become an entitled jerk."
4,52,Michael,"Thank you, Janet."
4,52,Janet,Make a doctor's appointment as soon as you get down there.
4,52,Janet,And no salty food.
4,52,Janet,You have to keep your blood pressure down.
4,52,Janet,You have blood now.
4,52,Michael,I'll be fine.
4,52,Michael,I'll be okay.
4,52,Janet,I know.
4,52,Janet,I just worry.
4,52,Michael,"I'll see you again, you know."
4,52,Michael,I'll see you when I get back.
4,52,Janet,Okay.
4,52,Janet,"If you rent a car, don't pay for the insurance, it's a scam."
4,52,Janet,Okay.
4,52,Michael Realman,"Man, it's hot."
4,52,Michael Realman,But it's a dry heat.
4,52,Janet,"So, as I mentioned before, you can sit on this bench as long as you want."
4,52,Janet,"And whenever you're ready, you just walk through."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Care to join me for a bit?
4,52,Janet,Margarita?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Always.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"Okay, top three moments of your not-life with us."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Go.
4,52,Janet,You telling us that we should try to help other people on Earth.
4,52,Janet,The moment that we all got into the Good Place for real.
4,52,Janet,And then it's an 8-million-way tie of every time Jason and I kissed.
4,52,Janet,He was a really good kisser.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I bet he was.
4,52,Janet,I wonder how Michael's doing?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,I assume he's doing the same as every human.
4,52,All,"Three, two, one"
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Some good days.
4,52,All,Happy New Year!
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Some bad days.
4,52,Michael Realman,She's gonna be okay.
4,52,Michael Realman,This city has really good hospitals.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,He's got a few friends.
4,52,Michael Realman,"You're such a good boy, Jason."
4,52,Michael Realman,Such a good boy.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,A few people he can't stand.
4,52,Michael Realman,Oh
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's learning some things, all by himself."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"And, hopefully, learning to ask for help when he needs it."
4,52,Guitar Teacher,Try like this.
4,52,Guitar Teacher,Fingers this way.
4,52,Michael Realman,You have no idea how long I've been trying to figure that out.
4,52,Guitar Teacher,"Well, everybody needs a teacher."
4,52,Guitar Teacher,"So, do it again."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"He's messing up, and trying again, and messing up again, and then getting things wrong, and then trying to make them right."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,That's what everyone does.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,To Michael.
4,52,Janet,To Michael.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Mmm.
4,52,Janet,What do you think happens when people walk through the door?
4,52,Janet,It's the only thing in the universe that I don't know.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"I don't know, either."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,The wave returns to the ocean.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,What the ocean does with the water after that is anyone's guess.
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,"But as a very wise not-robot once told me, ""The true joy is in the mystery."""
4,52,Janet,Do you mind if I stay here until you're gone?
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,Only if you say that thing I taught you.
4,52,Janet,"I hate to see you walk through the final door at the edge of existence, but I love to watch you leave."
4,52,Eleanor Shellstrop,There we go.
4,52,Ken,"Hey, this was delivered to my building by mistake."
4,52,Ken,I think it's yours.
4,52,Michael Realman,Oh.
4,52,Michael Realman,"Hey, thanks so much."
4,52,Ken,Mmm-hmm.
4,52,Michael Realman,"Oh, wow!"
4,52,Michael Realman,I think I know what this is.
4,52,Michael Realman,"Oh oh, my."
4,52,Michael Realman,"Oh, my."
4,52,Michael Realman,Look at that.
4,52,Michael Realman,"Oh, thank you."
4,52,Michael Realman,"Thank you so very, very much!"
4,52,Ken,"Yeah, no problem."
4,52,Ken,Take it easy.
4,52,Michael Realman,I'll do you one better.
4,52,Michael Realman,"I'll say this to you, my friend, with all the love in my heart, and all the wisdom of the universe."
4,52,Michael Realman,Take it sleazy.
4,52,Ken,All right.
